It is supposed to reflect the health of the listed universe of Indian companies, and hence the broader economy, in all market conditions. Officially called the Nifty50, the index is computed using the free float market capitalisation method, which is essentially the count of shares in active circulation in the market at any given point of time. The Nifty, just like BSE benchmark Sensex, is today used for benchmarking portfolios and returns of mutual fund schemes and launching index funds. The Nifty index was launched on April 22, 1996, with a base value of 1,000 counted from November 3, 1995. Live Nifty quotes are available on NSEIndia.com, ETMarkets.com and numerous other web platforms and TV channels at any point of time. The Nifty brand and indices are managed by the Mumbai-based India Index Services and Products Limited, IISL in short, which itself is a subsidiary of NSE. IISL has a three-tier governance structure comprising the board of directors, the index policy committee and the index maintenance sub-committee. IISL managed some 67 indices under the Nifty brand as of September 30, 2016. IISL rebalances the Nifty index semi-annually. The cut-off dates for the semi-annual review of the index are January 31 and July 31 each year. Average data for the six months ending the cut-off date is considered. The exchange notifies any change in the index four weeks before such changes take effect. There are defined eligibility criteria for selection of Nifty constituent stocks. The liquidity of a stock is measured by the market impact cost, which is essentially the cost involved in transacting a stock. For a stock to qualify for inclusion in the Nifty50, it must have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less for six months and for 90 per cent of observation cases. Besides, the company must have a listing history of at least six months. However, a newly-listed company, which has just got listed through the IPO route, may become eligible for inclusion in the index, if it fulfils the normal eligibility criteria for a three- month period instead of six months. Only those stocks which are eligible for trade in the F&O segment of NSE are considered for inclusion as Nifty constituents. As of September 20, 2017, the Nifty had 35.73 per cent components from the financial services sector, 14 per cent from the energy sector, 11.46 per cent from the information technology sector, 10.64 per cent from the automobile sector and 10.13 per cent from the consumer goods sector. Six of the nine BFSI companies in the Nifty50 were private banks. The Nifty index also has several variants such as Nifty Junior, Nifty50 USD, Nifty50 Total Returns index and NIFTY50 Dividend Points Index. BROWSE COMPANIES:", "Published Date": null},

While business is important, I focus more on how I can grow as a person. Business, profitability, and making a living will follow naturally. I’m happy to have built something from the ground up, starting from zero. Also, I am looking far beyond this business as well. :  Yes, my son completed his MBA from NMIMS, and has joined Bluecom to support the growth of our dream company. Since the industry is going through a transformation phase, I am happy to see him lead many efforts to grow further. Today, it’s all about a solution-centric approach. Customers no longer want just products; they want comprehensive solutions. This shift is something I expect him to drive within the company. He has the bandwidth to keep up with the latest technology. He is grooming and learning new technologies and initiatives in the market to integrate with his existing portfolio of products. I am looking forward to him as we will reach to new heights under the leadership of the new generation.  : Without their support and confidence, Bluecom would not have reached where it is now. Distribution is Bluecom’s one of the strongest verticals. This is the comprehensive approach that we have reached in the distribution vertical this far.

This global survey of 1,000 security and IT professionals across 11 countries, reveals interesting behavior changes for organizations that have been breached versus those that have not. The Commvault survey, done in collaboration with GigaOm, shows that organizations that have endured cyber incidents in the past don't want to get burned again. Consequently, they often reassess and invest in cyber resilience and recovery strategies in very meaningful ways. According to the survey: Investments in cyber resilience increase: Organizations that have been breached spend nearly 30% more on cybersecurity measures than those that haven't. More attention is given to understanding data risk profiles: Breached organizations are nearly 2.5 times more likely to prioritize understanding their data risk profiles, which highlight data types and relative levels of risk. Cyber readiness testing is prioritized: Breached organizations conduct more testing to find gaps in their cyber preparedness plans. Twenty percent of organizations that haven't been breached do not test their recovery plan at all, that number drops to just 2% for organizations that have been breached. The impact of these added investments and focus on cyber resilience is significant. According to the survey, breached organizations that have invested in comprehensive cyber recovery plans recover 41% faster than their less-prepared counterparts. In terms of specific recovery times, breached organizations state that they are 32% more likely to recover within 48 hours compared to those that have not been breached – a much better outcome than the recovery times noted by other respondents, which could be three weeks or more. This reduced downtime can translate to significant savings, both in terms of direct financial losses and the preservation of customer trust and brand reputation. \"We've all heard the expression hindsight is 20/20, and that could not be more applicable when it comes to the findings of this survey,\" said  . \"Our survey shows that the most resilient organizations are those that continuously test and refine their recovery strategies, learning from each incident to strengthen their defenses. It's this proactive mindset, rather than reactive spending, that makes the difference.\" Much like health insurance, where the cost of coverage often far outweighs the potential expenses of medical emergencies, cyber recovery readiness serves a similar purpose. The report underscores that the costs of being breached – ranging from operational disruption to regulatory fines – far exceed the expenses of proactive cyber resilience measures. \"The findings should be a call to action for all organizations, not just those that have been breached,\" said  . \"Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and so too must the strategies to counter them. It's about adopting a holistic approach to cyber resilience that integrates people, processes, and technology, ensuring readiness at every level.\" In addition to these findings, Commvault and GigaOm were able to pinpoint five key capabilities, also called resiliency markers, that when deployed together, helped companies recover faster from cyberattacks and experience fewer breaches compared to companies that did not follow the same path. These five resiliency markers emerged after data analysis teams combed through the same survey results across a range of topics including: how often companies were breached, what resilience technologies were (or were not) deployed, and how rapidly businesses were able to recover data and resume normal operations.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

{"Article URL": "https://digitalterminal.in/trending/ai-and-automation-drive-50-faster-software-development-outsystems-and-kpmg-survey-reveals", "Title": "AI and Automation Drive 50% Faster Software Development, OutSystems and KPMG Survey Reveals", "Author Name": null, "Author URL": null, "Article Content": "As the reach of artificial intelligence (AI) expands, IT leaders are exploring new use cases for technology used throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), according to a new survey launched today titled “AI in software development: Exploring opportunities and uncertainties” by OutSystems, a global leader transforming how companies innovate through software, and KPMG, a multinational professional services network. The research surveyed 555 software executives around the world whose companies span IT consultancy services, manufacturing, banking, financial services and insurance among others. 84 percent of respondents reported that their organizations first began to incorporate AI technologies in their SDLCs between six months to five years ago, with the earliest adopters primarily being IT services companies. Across regions, EMEA and North America remain roughly on equal footing, while APAC is steadily catching up. The findings show that testing, quality assurance, and security vulnerability detection are by far the most widely adopted use cases for AI in software development. Nonetheless, generative AI (GenAI) is set to transform the industry by significantly enhancing these processes and introducing unprecedented capabilities. Early adopters are planning to increase their use of AI in other stages of the SDLC, such as user interface design, code generation, DevOps optimization, and application maintenance. Nearly all respondents are planning to increase their investment in AI-augmented SDLC management over the next two years, indicating that AI will play a central role in driving innovation and competitive advantage in the software industry. “AI is redefining the impossible,” said Paulo Rosado, CEO and founder at OutSystems. “I’m laser-focused on helping teams compress multi-year legacy modernization projects into just a few months. The latest AI disruptions have brought us the potential to compress these development timelines into even shorter and faster projects. With AI, historically impossible transformation projects are not only possible but easier, cheaper, and faster to accomplish.” “Right now, the developer’s role is shifting from code writer to code reviewer,” said Rodrigo Coutinho, Co-founder and AI Project Manager at OutSystems. “Large language models (LLMs) are a big help, but they still make mistakes. But as these models evolve, and trust in the resulting code improves, the developer’s role will be more akin to that of an orchestrator and acceptance tester of AI-generated outputs.” Despite being a nascent technology a couple of years ago, the report found that confidence in the quality of AI-generated code has risen substantially—half of respondents said that the implementation of AI has improved software quality, enhanced decision-making, and increased efficiency in software testing and quality assurance. But confidence is also paired with risk awareness surrounding tech debt in the form of orphan code and hallucinations, a lack of context for an organization’s specific coding needs, and scalability concerns. With strategy baked into AI in SDLC processes, 56% of respondents said they experienced or expected to experience a higher quality of applications, with fewer bugs and improved performance.   The AI opportunity is undeniably huge, but its wider adoption in other areas of the SDLC beyond software testing and vulnerability detection still face some barriers. Chief among these are data privacy and security concerns (56% of respondents) and regulatory and compliance challenges (42%). Moreover, 38% of executives cite difficulties integrating generative AI into existing workflows as the primary barrier to adoption. “There’s a lot of speculation on what will change with the rise of GenAI,” said Michael Harper, Managing Director at KPMG U.S. “While there will be challenges, those with effective change management initiatives will reskill and upskill their workforces, leading to AI and jobs evolving in tandem.” The speed and sprawl of AI, namely GenAI, is paving the way for an increase in investments for nearly all respondents. But risks concerning the reliability of AI-generated code persist, though they can be mitigated with existing approaches, such as user acceptance testing, unit testing, and regression testing. “It’s up to the developer working with AI to guarantee the quality of the deliverables, but this becomes way more efficient with AI,” said Coutinho. “AI is, in fact, a great partner in creating tests in synthetic data.” Other oft-cited concerns were the limited availability of skilled personnel and difficulties integrating GenAI into existing tech stacks and workflows. Fears of job losses are high as well, with 89% of respondents claiming that certain roles will be eliminated by AI. This falls in line with a broader industry trend over the last couple of years. However, in the longer term, AI may well create more jobs than it displaces, resulting in a new type of developer, equipped with specialized AI skill sets.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

This idea has been with us since we started the operations of our company almost five years ago. Today, I am very happy to say that it has finally been accomplished. This is our contribution to the nation, demonstrating that we are not dependent on any other country for software solutions; we have created our own. 'Mannat' Writing Board software is going to revolutionize the industry as it is the first software integrated with inbuilt content for everything. Currently, we have added NCERT content and plan to include ICSE board content and other curricula. We also aim to convert the content videos into 14 regional languages, making it accessible to a wider audience. Our goal is to make digital teaching available on all panels so that everyone can benefit from it. Over the past 25 years, since the advent of smart classes, there has always been a challenge of using different software for content and writing boards, causing confusion among teachers. With five years of hard work, we have finally integrated a whiteboard with content, making it user-friendly and easy for teachers to use. Before launching, we took feedback from over 200 to 500 teachers by showing them free demos and organizing classes to understand their needs and preferences. Based on their feedback, we have included mathematical tools, chemistry tools, physics tools, images, videos, books, PPTs, 3D images, and more. Previously, various software offered limited features, but now we have consolidated everything into one software, making it a win-win situation for us. As industry leaders, we wanted a leading personality to represent our brand. We didn't want someone who plays a secondary or tertiary role; we wanted a hero. Abhay Deol perfectly fits this image. Additionally, he was my daughter's choice as well, which made the decision even more meaningful. We initially discussed the idea with him last year, and after waiting for a year, we are finally able to bring this collaboration. This product is not only compatible with our hardware, but anyone, any brand, can purchase and use it with their hardware. The idea is that the future battle lies in software, not hardware. While hardware is common among people, software presents a challenge. We have taken the initiative, as we always do, because we are the leaders and must act as such. Others had an equal opportunity to do so, but no one took advantage of it. We believe we have been blessed to do it. The first version is already available, and every month, users will receive a new update. We aim to achieve a market share of 30 to 40% in next one year. In August, we are launching the Android version as well, so anyone can use it on Android or Windows. Initially, we are collaborating with our partners and all the brands associated with us. We provide them with our software, which they can sell under their own branding. We are also offering this as a white-label solution. I believe that within the next year, most brands will be associated with our software and will adopt it. Just like in all government projects where the government has mandated the use of Indian software and products, they require software for both Android and Windows platforms, and both should be the same. I think we will be the only company in India to have this capability. No other company offers software for both Windows and Android with the same specifications and features. While many Chinese companies are doing this, they face restrictions from the government. Therefore, I believe that India will be the only country where a manufacturer will have both Android and Windows versions with the same specs and features. The digital revolution is underway, and we are committed to contributing our best efforts to it. We are not leading a revolution but are merely playing a part in it, striving to add our numbers and efforts to the cause. The success of our contribution relies on the support and love from people and the guidance of God. I promise to India that this year, we will have India's largest IT manufacturing facility in Punjab. We have already acquired the land, and the construction work is underway. This year, we promise to have the largest manufacturing unit in India, located in Punjab. We have already initiated many steps in this direction, and I believe we will be able to start the factory around Diwali. This will be our gift to India. We are also exporting our software application. We have orders from Dubai, and many customers from Dubai are interested. Even our vendors, from whom we buy raw materials, are willing to buy the software under their name. However, my idea was to start from India. Once the software gains popularity in India, we can then expand to other countries. We have already developed a website for online purchases. People can buy online from our Dubai office. We are open to customization requests as well, and we can tailor the software to meet specific needs.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ", "Published Date": null},

The Chinese technology company exhibited the latest Mate XT, a three-way foldable handset such as an accordion screen door, in the Shenzhen tech hub launch ceremony. The smartphone has already received over 4 million pre-orders that required no deposit, as per the company’s website. According to research organization IDC, the entire global market for foldable phones, in the second quarter, was around 4 million units. The world’s first triple foldable phone has arrived. Breaking boundaries and redefining possibilities. Delivering an immersive and dynamic experience completely unlike anything you have ever imagined.      \"Today we bring you a product that everyone can think of but could not make. Our team has been working hard for five years and has never given up,\" Richard Yu, Huawei executive director stated at the launch. \"Today we will once again rewrite the history of the industry, turn science fiction into reality, and lead a new era of folding devices.\" AI functions are bolstered with in-house Kylin chips of Huawei, he added. The new phone features an AI assistant alongside translation, text summary, and editing functions, along with AI-boosted image editing capabilities such as removing unwanted parts from the photos, Yu said. The highly anticipated launch follows right hours after Apple introduced its latest lineup - the AI-supported iPhone 16, both smartphones are due to up on sale on 20  September. The Mate XT is available in red and black colours and boasts a 10.2-inch display screen. The company claims that its 3.6mm width makes it the slimmest foldable phone in the world and also has a keyboard attached easy to fit in the pocket. The 256-gigabyte model is priced at 19,999 yuan, with higher memory options available at 21,999 yuan and 23,999 yuan, as per Reuters. The launch, following a string of successful smartphone releases, highlights Huawei's resilience in overcoming U.S. sanctions and strengthens its position over Apple in China, where consumers have criticized the iPhone 16 for lacking AI features. Apple is still in search of an AI partner in China to enhance its iPhone 16 series, while its AI software, Apple Intelligence, will not be available in Chinese languages until next year.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

Za ovu listu, ispitali su više od 150.000 vozila godišta od 2014. do 2109. u vlasništvu svojih članova, upoređujući broj problema koje je svaki auto imao s prosekom za sva vozila. Ovim procesom su dobijeni rezultati pouzdanosti za svaku marku. Lexus i Toyota bili su najpouzdanije marke polovnih automobila s velikom razlikom u odnosu na sve ostale, potvrđujući svoju reputaciju među kupcima, piše Auto Klub. Stiven Elek, voditelj programa Consumer Reportsa za analitiku podataka o automobilima, rekao je da su ove dve marke poznate po \"konzervativnom postupnom poboljšavanju cijele linije proizvoda, umjesto uvođenja mnogih potpuno novih sustava\". Ovo je lista najboljih marki rabljenih automobila: Dok ove lestvice daju širok pogled na pouzdanost marke, stručnjaci ipak savetuju da se prilikom kupovine istraži svaki model pojedinačno. Osim toga, treba uzeti u obzir i cienu i vrstu popravki. Jedno vozilo može imati više problema s jeftinim popravkama, dok bi drugo moglo biti sklono manjem broju skupih problema.

Auto ima kilometražu na meraču 176.000 kilometara, tako sam ga kupila i registrovala. Sat vremena kasnije otvaram ladicu auta i nalazim urednu servisnu knjižicu sa više datuma servisa i zadnji je iz maja rađen na 274.000 kilometara. \"Da nisam saznala, bilo bi mi lakše. Naravno, zvala sam ih, oni, naravno, nisu ništa znali ni garantovali... Registrovana je firma preko koje sam kupila. Da li imam neke zakonske osnove da ih gonim?\", napisala je ona.

Nije tajna da nam polovnjaci najviše dolaze iz Evrope, a budući da Srbi vole da pazare automobile sa Zapada, bitno je proveriti da li su preživeli poplavu ili su sve vreme bili na suvom! Ovo su neki znakovi da je automobil bio poplavljen: Obratite pažnju na koroziju - Automobili u godinama, koji su prešli više stotina hiljada kilometara, sa spoljne strane mogu imati koroziju, ali ne i unutra! Ono što morate da znate jeste, da korozija unutar kabine se ne pojavljuje ni nakon 30 godina vožnje.. Naravno ako automobil nije bio potopljen. Međutim, ukoliko je bio potopljen, koroziju je moguće primetiti u donjim tačkama kabine. U tom slučaju najbolje je detaljno pogledati gepek i prostor oko rezervnog točka. Obavezno podignite rubove tepiha i vidite šta je ispod njih. Za kraj obavezno pogledajte šine sedišta i prostor ispod sedišta (koristite ogledalo i baterijsku lamu ako je nepristupačno). Kako su pomenute šine presvučene najtanjim slojem zaštite, njihova korozija bi mogla da ukaže na to da je automobil bio potopljen. Problem sa elektronikom - Ako majstor ne može da popravi grešku u elektronici, eto vama mogućnosti da je automobil bio poplavljen! Kako instalacije prve stradaju od strane korozije, obavezno je proveriti da li svi pokazivači i sva svetla rade, kako spolja tako i iznutra, potom da li ventilacija i klima rade, zajedno sa upaljačem. Tokom testiranja automobila pre kupovine, obavezno pri paljenju oslušnite da li automobil, tj. njegova elektronika proizvodi neočekivane zvukove, ili neočekivan smrad paljevine, koji može da ukaže na neispravnost elektronike. Promena tepiha, neba i presvlaka - Ukoliko se radi o skupom automobilu, izvlačenje vlage i korišćenje hemikalija nije opcija, već će majstori preko grane posegnuti za promenom tepiha, neba i presvlaka. U slučaju da je automobil stariji od 6-7 godina, lako se može ustanoviti da se radi o novim već pomenutim elementima. Amortizacija oko prostora stopala, i na vozačevom ili suvozačevom mestu, treba treba detaljno da se pregleda, jer ako je automobil vožen više od 6-7 godina, znakovi amortizacije i rabljena moraju da budu prisutni (izlizanost tepiha na pojedinim mestima recimo). Ako su presvlake nove, pa ručno šivene, to može biti \"red flag\" za automobil koji je realno stariji. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ).

Najbolje je da ne kupujete \"bolesnike\" odnosno   koji su pregaženi u gradskoj vožnji, kreni-stani, te koji su prešli stotine hiljada kilometara. Ipak, ako niste automehaničar i nemate jednog u familiji, valja znati kako proveriti da li je vaš potencijalni automobil zapravo problematičan iako je naoko lep, našminkan i sa manjom kilometražom. A tu su bitne 3 stvari na polovnom automobilu koje otkrivaju da je porešao mnogo. U suštini, automobil uvek treba razgledati po danu! Bitno je pogledati šasiju, (tzv. VIN), gde treba obratiti pažnju na šire područje oko broja – možda je čitav komad lima sa brojem isečen i zavaren novi ili je na neki drugi način falsifikovan. Proveru možete da obavite u policiji (ima slučajeva da su vozila oduzimana i po godinu ili dve dana nakon što su prošla proveru u policiji) ili u Centru za motorna vozila (CMZ) Auto–moto saveza Srbije. Postoji i stara, ali nepouzdana provera magnetom – ako se magnet ne  lepi za neku površinu, možete posumnjati da se ispod laka nalazi git.

Prva lekcija u auto-školama jeste upravo ta da, ukoliko ne postoji  znak, ili druga oznaka, propustite vozilo koja vam nailazi sa desne strane, u slučaju da nailazite na put iste važnosti. Postoji, međutim, i druga signalizacija koja ima gotovo istu snagu, a da su je vozači potpuno izgubli iz vida. Međutim, u slučaju saonraćajne nesreće možete biti krivi i platiti štetu, a da pojma nemate da ste izazvali udes nepoštujući zakon.  se, naime, deli na vertikalnu signalizaciju i horizontalnu signalizaciju. Bilo da se radi o vertikalnoj ili horizontalnoj saobračajnoj signalizaciji, njena namena je regulisanje ili usmeravanje saobraćaja, obeležavanje vozila ili obezbeđivanje mesta izvođenja radova na kolovozu. Horizontalna signalizacija Horizontalna signalizacija predstavlja skup posebno oblikovanih geometrijskih elemenata linija, figura, polja i natpisa koji formiraju oznake na saobraćajnim površinama. Horizontalna signalizacija postoji i na drugim površinama: parkinzima, trotoarima, komunikacijama unutar garaža, aerodromskim pistama itd. Osnovna podela horizontalne signalizacije potiče od namene oznaka. Ova podela uslovljena je položajem oznaka u odnosu na simetralu kolovoza puta ili ulice: uzdužne oznake(razdelne linije, ivične linije, linije vodilje i sl), poprečne oznake, linije zaustavljanja (ova oznaka se često naziva i \"stop\" linija), pešački prelazi, prelazi biciklističkih staza, kosnici,graničnici, itd. i ostale oznake, strelice, natpisi, polja i linije za usmeravanje, oznake za parkiranje itd. Damir Okanović, direktor Komiteta za bezbednost saobraćaja, navodi da horizontalna signalizacija ima obavezujući karakter. \"Po važećim propisima ako na prilazu raskrsnici nisu postavljeni STOP ili obrnuti trougao, a na kolovozu postoji linija zaustavljanja (zaustavna linija) vozači se obaveštavaju o obavezi zaustavljanja odnosno propuštanja vozila na putu na koji nailaze, samom zaustavnom linijom. Pošto vozač može da ne vidi zaustavnu liniju usled npr. snega na kolovozu ili vozila koje se kreće ispred njegovog, nije dobro da na raskrsnici bude samo zaustavna linija bez znaka STOP ili bez obrnutog trougla. Zbog toga učesnici u saobraćaju kada primete da postoji zaustavna linija a nema znaka STOP ili obrnutog trougla, treba da obaveste upravljača puta kako bi postavili saobraćajni znak\", objašnjava Okanović. Ako blagovremeno uočite zaustavnu liniju na kolovozu, a ne propustite vozila na putu na koji ste naišli, možete prekršajno ali i krivično odgovarati. Zbog toga obratite pažnju i na horizontalnu signalizaciju kada nailazite na raskrnicu, jer može skupo da vas košta.

Kriptovalute su prešle sa digitalnih kurioziteta na sredstva koja se koriste za različite transakcije, uključujući kupovinu softvera i, kontroverzno, ilegalne aktivnosti.   Međutim, kritičari tvrde da oni olakšavaju kriminalne aktivnosti i doprinose nestabilnosti i nejednakosti tržišta.

Druge kriptovalute poput Ethereuma, pa čak i šaljive valute kao što je Dogecoin, takođe su postale popularne. Kao odgovor na bum kriptovaluta, mnoge vlade istražuju uvođenje digitalnih valuta centralne banke (CBDC - Central Bank Digital Currency).   CBDC nude prednosti kriptovaluta brzinu i digitalnu efikasnost, bez povezanih rizika neregulisanih sredstava. Međutim, oni dolaze sa sopstvenim izazovima, uključujući zabrinutost oko centralizacije moći i podataka u jednoj instituciji.

Neregulisana priroda kriptovaluta dovela je do zabrinutosti zbog prevare, utaje poreza i finansijske stabilnosti.  Uprkos svom potencijalu, kriptovalute kao što je Bitkoin se i dalje prvenstveno koriste za špekulacije, a mnogi investitori se nadaju dugoročnim dobitima zasnovanim na budućim primenama blokčejn tehnologije.

Njegov autorski opus zaista je ogroman i o tome sam više puta pisao. U ovom tekstu pokušaću da vas podsetim na segment njegovog stvaralaštva koji je ovdašnjoj publici svakako manje poznat, ali je zaista izuzetan, a i njemu samom bio je jako važan. Ako govorimo o domaćoj instrumentalnoj muzici koju su stvarali rok muzičari, svakako stoji da ona nije lako pronalazila put do slušalaca, a ako i jeste, to su uglavnom bili gitarski instrumentali. Setimo se recimo kompozicija kao što su \"Dinamit\" Josipa Bočeka, \"Ulazak u harem\" R.M. Točka ili \"Jednoj ženi\" Zlatka Manojlovića. Takođe, tu su i mnoge sjajne obrade iz ovdašnjeg etno nasleđa, poput \"Aber dojde Donke\" grupe Leb i Sol, \"Zajdi, zajdi\" od Smaka, ili izvanredne Točkove solo partije koju je doneo u kompoziciji \"Ukor\". Kasnije su neki od ovih gitarista objavili i svoje instrumentalne albume, a među prvima su to uradili R.M. Točak (1977.), a takođe i Zlatko Manojlović (1980.). O gotovo svim gore navedenim kompozicijama pisao sam tekstove, ali svakako ne treba smetnuti s uma da postoji i izuzetan instrumentalni, autorski opus, koji su u onim zlatnim danima rok muzike ostavili iza sebe neki od naših najpoznatijih klavijaturista. Jedan od prvih solo albuma objavio je Tihomir Pop Asanović (\"Majko zemljo\" 1974.), ali s obzirom da je taj LP pretežno vokalni (izuzev kompozicija \"Berlin I\" i \"Berlin II\"),  Kornelije Kovač svakako spada u red onih pionira koji su se odvažili da krenu u vode instrumentalne muzike Zašto kažem odvažio? Možda je najbolje objašnjenje za to dao sam Kornelije u jednom intervjuu koji sam vodio s njim:  (iz knjige \"Gramofonske priče\", autora Gorana Živanovića) Da je ovo tačno, svedoči i činjenica da je mnogo više onih koji su, nakon prestanka rada Korni grupe, upoznati sa Kornelijevim kompozitorskim radom za naše tada veoma popularne pevače kao što su to recimo Zdravko Čolić, Bisera Veletanlić, Zlatko Pejaković itd, nego sa njegovim solo ostvarenjima. U tekstu koji sledi podsetiću vas na nekoliko kompozicije iz tog opusa. Ovo je prva ploča koju je Kornelije Kovač objavio pod svojim imenom nakon razlaza Korni grupe. Sećam se da sam komoziciju \"Okean\" prvi put čuo kada sam bio osmi razred. Bio sam naprosto očaran. Toliko mi se svideo taj instrumental da sam odmah shvatio kako tu ploču moram imati što pre. Kornelije je ovde po ko zna koji put pokazao koliki je majstor svog zanata. Iako se kompozicija \"Okean\" našla na B strani ovog singla, tih godina mnogo češće je emitovana na talasima radio stanica, mada ni A strana na kojoj je \"Severni vetar\", nije ništa lošija i zvuči stvarno svetski. Ovo je za mene jedan od onih čarobnih singlova iz sedamdesetih godina, ploča koja pokazuje kakvi talenti su stasavali u jednoj relativno maloj zemlji kao što je to Jugoslavija. Nakon ovog fantastičnog singla, mnogi su očekivali (među njima i ja) sledeći Kornelijev potez. U stvari čekao se album. Do realizacije takve ideje nikada nije došlo, a razlozi za to nisu bili do kraja jasni. Tada se govorkalo da je čitav plan propao jer je Dado bio neodlučan, čas je hteo, čas nije, da se priključi grupi. Međutim, Dadovo mišljenje sasvim je drugačije, što mi je i izneo u jednom razgovoru: (misli na gradove u kojima su živeli muzičari koji su trebali da sviraju u K2, op. autora) Interesantno je da će gotovo svi članovi ove zamišljene super grupe svirati na Kornelijevom prvom solo albumu. Dakle, tu su bili gitarista Josip Boček, basista Čarli Novak, klavijaturisti Sloba Marković i Sanja Ilić, bubnjari Lazar Tošić i Ratko Divjak, dok su pevačke deonice podelili Zvezdana Sterle, Nada Žgur i Oto Pestner.  Taj LP je u suštini bio dobar, na njemu je bilo dosta vokalnih kompozicija, ali ruku na srce, čini se da nije bilo neke koja bi mogla da povuče ceo album. U jednom razgovoru upitao sam ga zašto je doneo takvu odluku, kada je ovde već stekao ime vredno svakog poštovanja, njegov odgovor bio je ovakav:  (iz knjige \"Gramofonske priče, autora Gorana Živanovića) LP je kao i prethodni objavila izdavačka kuća PGP RTB i to je stvarno bila odlično urađena ploča. Na ploči se nalazi i par sjajnih instrumentala poput \"Scottish Bird\", a tu je i instrumentalna verzija poznate pesme Korni grupe, \"Put za istok\". Tih godina slušao sam ga jako puno, jednostavno nisam mogao da prestanem. Iako je Kornelije i dalje objavljivao svoja solo ostvarenja, ja ću u ovoj priči upravo ovde stati. Sa ploče\"Sampled Moon\"  gotovo da sam mogao odabrati bilo koju kompoziciju za ovaj prikaz, ipak, odlučio sam se za \"Still Chicken\" i \"Anna F\". Za prvu, mnogi koji su je čuli uopšte i ne znaju da je iz opusa Kornelija Kovača, dok je druga posvećena Ani Frank i jedina je kompozicija na albumu u kojoj je korišćen glas, ali u funkciji instrumenta. Tu deonicu otpevala je Kornelijeva ćerka Aleksandra koja je tada imala samo četrnaest godina. Međutim, isto tako, mogao sam se odlučiti i za nestvarnu \"Get It Right Boy\", ili na primer \"Cola-Kid\", ili za više nego sjajnu \"Dancing On The White Beach\". Interesantno je da je bilo zlobnika koji su tvrdili da je Kornelije inspiraciju za ovu poslednju pronašao u kompoziciji \"Get Out of Your Lazy Bed\", koju je par godina ranije objavila britanska grupa Matt Bianco. Malo šta je delovalo tako opuštajuće i umirujuće kao ova ploča. Bar je kod mene bilo tako. Nažalost, ako na YOU TUBE danas pogledate broj pregleda ovih kompozicija, razočaraćete se. Ta brojka jedva da dostiže nekoliko hiljada (izuzev kompozicije \"Okean\" koja ima nešto više\"), Srećom ima i onih, među koje ubrajam i sebe, kojima ti pregledi apsolutno ništa ne znače i na to se uopšte i ne obaziru. I da: Kornelije je pisao i sjajnu filmsku muziku, zatim špice za mnoge popularne televizijske i radio emisije, i tu takođe ima sjajnih instrumentala, ali o svemu tome možda u nekoj od naših narednih priča. Njegova muzika zauvek će obasjavati ove prostore. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ). Telegraf.rs zadržava sva prava nad sadržajem.

Svetske premijere u svetskom, a srpskom teatru tek slede. \"LU\" je predstava koja donosi priču o Princu Tame, Luciferu, iz potpuno drugačijeg ugla. Lucifer je po kazni poslat na Zemlju, među ljude. Ali postoje likovi koji mogu da iznenade i samog Lucifera. Kad pokuša da kupi dušu opštinskog funkcionera Srbe i usput se zaljubi u njegovu sestru Veru, Lucifer ne može da veruje šta ga je snašlo. Shvata šta je ljubav – da zbog nje žene plaču, a muškarci piju i lažu da ne plaču. I Lu je upao u tu klopku i mora da se izbori sam sa sobom, jer ako pokaže slabost – gubi sve što je Princu Tame važno.

Marjanović je istakao da mu je bilo čudno da kroči u svet \"Močvare\" jer je, do tada, seriju posmatrao samo iz ugla gledaoca. \"Bilo je čudno kročiti u astmosferu, misterioznost i tajanstvenost, ali bilo mi je zanimljivo da gledam kako se to stvara. Kako Oleg to režira i kako vodi pažljivo glumce kroz to. I zapitao bih se da li ja sad snimam i prisustvujem ovde ili ne. Drugačije je, bez obzira što je čovek glumac, drugačije je kad učestvuješ i kad stvaraš, a drugačije je kada to posmatraš\", objasnio je on. Prema njegovim rečima, čast i privilegija je sarađivati sa rediteljem Olegom Novkovićem i igrati u komadima čije dramske tekstove piše Milena Marković. \"Učiš je na fakultetu i čitaš njene drame i sad odjednom razgovaraš sa njom i igraš u seriji koju je ona pisala. To je kao prisustvovati tom činu stvaranja i gledati njih kako rade. To je meni bilo najzanimljivije\", objasnio je Marjanović. Marjanović tumači ulogu mladog inspektora Miloša koji je \"štreberski nastrojen prema poslu i želi da se dokaže\". Pored toga, Marijanović je istakao da je ta uloga bila glumački zahtevna kada je scenario, koji se odnosi na prisustvo mrtvim telima, u pitanju. \"Nažalost sam imao iskustvo prisustva jednoj obdukciji iz ličnih razloga. Priključio sam se obdukciji nekog tela na pravnom fakultetu jer je moj cimer studirao prava.. Obdukciji je prisustvovao i neki profesor na akademiji i rekao nam je kako bi bilo super iskustvo da mi kao glumci odemo da pogledamo\", rekao je on. Prema njegovim rečima prisustvo obdukciji je posebno iskustvo iako se čovek u početku plaši da priđe čoveku koji nije živ. \"To zapravo nije čovek, ima obrise ljudskog, vidi se i misao na njemu i to je nešto što je bila osoba i to je nešto strašno. Mi nemamo iskustvo da vidimo ljude koji su mrtvi. Mi samo razgovaramo i komuniciramo sa živim ljudima i kad naiđeš na nešto što znaš da je bilo živo, a sad više nije, jako ti je to čudno\", rekao je Marjanović.

Ovo je njihov četvrti nastup u Pirotu, a u Srbiji su nastupali pre Pirota u Beogradu i Novom Sadu. U Pirot međutim dolaze četvrti put, zadnji put su bili pre više od decenije, a pevač benda Artur Alan kaže za Telegraf.rs da u Srbiju uvek rado dolaze i to sa posebnim emocijama. -Mi smo četvrti put u Pirotu. Zadnji put je bilo davno pre možda 15 godina, tada je sa nama bio i bivši frontmen benda i svojevrsno zaštitno lice benda Kris Broderik, koji je nažalost preminuo pre par godina. Sada ćemo dosta njegovih pesama svirati, ali u novom ruhu, imamo veći saund, imamo violinu, mandolinu u bendu, osim standardnog bubnja i dve gitare-kaže Alan, uz konstataciju da njega i njegove klupske drugare posebno oduševljava srpska hrana. -Hrana je ovde fenomenalna, svašta smo probali, mnogo vrsta mesa, sve je izvrsno, jedan od kolega je oduševljen pirotskim sirom, kačkavaljem, koga je probao ovde-priča Alan i dodaje da će bend na veliku evropsku turneju zapravo krenuti naredne godine, a ovo je svega nekoliko koncerata po Engleskoj, i odmah zatim Srbiji, kako bi se publici predstavio novi album. Alan kaže da jedna od stvari koji ih je fascinirala još kada su prvi put došli u Srbiju, bila činjenica da Srbi prosto obožavaju kultnu engelsku seriju Mućke. -Jedan od mlađih članova nije mogao da veruje kada je u Beogradu iz stana u kome smo bili, pogledavši kroz prozor, video ogroman grafit \"Only fools and horses\". Tada sam mu, s obzirom da sam ranije bio sa starom postavkom, objasnio da ovde svi obožavaju Rodnija, Del Boja i ostale aktere Mućki, što je potpuno fascinantno-kaže Alan. Koncert u Pirotu oduševio je publiku u holu Doma kulture koja je, na iznenađenje ovog kultnog benda, horski pevala brojne hitove \"Kraljeva Delte Midveja\", kako ih još nazivaju u Engleskoj. (A.Ć.)

Festival „7 veličanstvenih“ u Mts dvorani - Telegraf.rs", "Author Name": null, "Author URL": null, "Article Content": "U petak 13. septembra svečano je otvoren 20. festival evropskog dugometražnog dokumentarnog filma “7 veličanstvenih” u Mts dvorani. Prisutnima su se na otvaranju obratili direktor festivala Zoran Popović, festivalski selektor Tue Stin Miler, i autor filma otvaranja „Pijanoforte“ Jakub Pjontek. Zoran Popović, direktor festivala „7 veličanstvenih“, na otvaranju je rekao: „Pre dvadeset godina postojao je samo san o velikom sjajnom bioskopu, o velikom platnu, o fantastičnim filmovima i veličanstvenoj publici. Nakon 20 godina, svi smo zajedno u tom snu, koji je uspeo da se ostvari. Da li zato što smo uložili svu našu snagu, trud i energiju da otvorimo široko vrata filmovima koji su i u Evropi tek dolazili i najavljivali jedno novo poglavlje u istoriji filma; da li zato što smo imali podršku zaista sjajnih, veličanstvenih evropskih dokumentarista i jednog izuzetnog Danca koji je gotovo postao Beograđanin, Tue Stin Milera; da li zato što je sve to spojila jedna veličanstvena, evropska publika, koja voli dokumentarni film, bioskop, i uživa u onome što je magija filma. Sve to zajedno, tokom dvadeset godina, stvaralo je legendu o festivalu, koju širom Evrope pronose eminentni evropski dokumentaristi, pričajući o nečemu što gotovo da nikada u svojoj karijeri nisu sreli, a događa se u Beogradu“. Tue Stin Miler, selektor festivala, ispričao je priču o imaginarnom susretu Hansa Kristijana Andersena i Nikole Tesle, i njihovom razgovoru o budućnosti pokretnih slika. „Oni nisu više ovde, ali pre neki dan sedeli su na jednom oblaku iznad Beograda. Andersen je rekao Tesli kako je ipak postojala mogućnost da se slike pokrenu. U Beogradu ima jedna tačka i jedno mesto gde se već 20 godina prikazuju slike koje se pokreću. S tvojim genijalnim umom i mojim pripovedanjem, te dve stvari su se spojile u nešto što ide zajedno, nešto veličanstveno. Andersen je bio u pravu. Živeo festival Sedam veličanstvenih!“ Jakub Pjontek, reditelj filma otvaranja „Pijanoforte“, prisutnima se obratio rečima: „Veoma sam privilegovan što sam ovde. Mlađi sam od 40 godina, pa mi 20 godina festivala izgleda kao divan san. Hvala vam na gostoprimstvu i nadam se da ćete uživati u filmu“. Po završetku ceremonije otvaranja, premijerno u Srbiji je prikazan film “Pijanoforte” koji nas vodi na najčuvenije svetsko takmičenje mladih pijanista. Kao svojevrsna pijanistička Olimpijada, svake pete godine u Varšavi se okupljaju vrhunski mladi umetnici i započinju bespoštednu borbu sa samima sobom da bi postigli gotovo nemoguće i savladali sve teže i teže zadatke i eventualno pobedili. Sjajni poljski autor Jakub Pjontek napravio je uzbudljiv i intrigantan film koji nas vodi iza kulisa ovog takmičenja, a najveće zadovoljstvo u filmu je pijanistički i filmski briljantno predstavljena muzika koja je opčinila gledaoce brojnih festivala širom sveta od Sandensa do Tel Aviva. Nakon projekcije održan je razgovor sa autorom filma. Program festivala nastavlja se u subotu, 14. septembra u 20 časova, filmom “Balomanija” danske rediteljke Sisel Morel Dargis. Do kraja festivala publika će moći da pogleda i ostvarenja “Tvoj život bez mene” mađarske rediteljke Ane Rubi (15. septembar, 18h), “Šaptač risovima” finskog reditelja Juhe Suonpe (15. septembar, 20h), „Gospodin Bo“ italijanske rediteljke Klaudije Tozi (16. septembar, 20h), „Ja sam reka, reka je ja“ holandskog reditelja Petra Loma (17. septembar, 20h), „Nenet“ Nikole Filibera (18. septembar, 20h, specijalna projekcija) i „Bilo jednom u jednoj šumi“ finske rediteljke Virpi Sutari (19. septembar, 20h), koji će zatvoriti festival. Festival su pomogli Ministarstvo kulture Republike Srbije, Ambasade Finske i Danske u Srbiji uz druge sponzore i medijske pokrovitelje.

I večeras, kao i na svim prethodnim svetkovinama kvalitetne muzike i lepe pesme, svedoci smo da umetnost i kultura predstavljaju jedan od najboljih načina zbližavanja i boljeg upoznavanja raznih naroda\", poručila je Gojković. Ona je istakla da je tamburica, jedan od najstarijih žičanih instrumenata, među najupečatljivijim delovima \"naše muzičke tradicije i kulturnog identiteta\". Gojković je podsetila na to da su očuvanje i negovanje kulturnog nasleđa, kao i njegovo prenošenje generacijama koje dolaze, među ključnim faktorima razvoja svakog društva. \"Briga o zaštiti naše kulturne baštine treba da bude važan zadatak svima nama koji se njome na bilo koji način bavimo. To uključuje i podršku koju Pokrajinska vlada pruža ustanovama, organizacijama i pojedincima koji vredno rade na očuvanju naše muzičke tradicije, među kojima je nesumnjivo i naš ‘Tamburica fest'\", navela je Gojković. Ona je dodala da o značaju tamburice govori i to što je tamburaška praksa 2021. godine upisana u Nacionalni registar nematerijalnog kulturnog nasleđa. Dodala je da su manifestacije poput ove važne, jer spajaju nasleđe sa savremenim stvaralaštvom, čineći tako tradiciju i običaje i \"živim\" i vidljivim, dajući im aktivnu ulogu u nastanku novih umetničkih dela. Na festivalu svake godine nastupaju orkestri iz zemlje i inostranstva u takmičarskom delu programa za najbolji orkestar Svetskog tamburica festa, a vokalni solisti iz celog sveta učestvuju u izboru za najbolju autorsku pesmu Tamburica festa. U okviru ove manifestacije nastala je i Svetska tamburaška asocijacija, udruženje svih tamburaša sveta sa sedištem u Novom Sadu, navodi se u saopštenju Pokrajinske vlade.

Enterijer Gocine dvospratna kuće opremljen je stilskim nameštajem i suvenirima, a kako je pevačica istakla, sve mora da joj bude pod konac. -Kod mene je red rad i disciplina i naravno red smeha - navela je pevačica i otkrila da je njena kuća zapravo njena oaza mira, a sve je dekorisala i opremila sama. Prostrani hodnik vodi do svih prostorija, a jedna od omiljenih prostorija joj je kuhinja jer ne može da zamisli dan bez jutarnje kafe. - Najviše volim ujutru da prvu kafu popijem potpuno sama, u tišini, ali napolju, u dvorištu. U stanju sam čak da sa skafanderom i kapom na glavi, čizmama izađem kada je hladno - priznala je Goca. I ne samo to, Goca je prava domaćica koja se ne libi da zasuče rukave i svojim najmilija pripremi specijalitete. - Spremam sve što moji vole, ali je sve to malo komplikovano jer moja ćerka ne jede meso, niti mast. Unuka ne jede sir, ni mleveno meso i onda kad dođe Božić kad se svi okupimo, ja pečem ćurku - priznala je pevačica. Osim u kuhinji, Goca većinu vremena provodi u trpezariji koju je opremila sa mnogo ljubavi. Elementi od punog drveta, svuda su zlatni detalji, uramljene skupocene slike na zidovima, vitrine sa posuđem i suvenirima koje je godinama donosila iz inostranstva. Cvetni aranžmani su neizostavni detalj svake prostorije, a malo ko zna da ih pevačica sama uzgaja u svojoj bašti. Pevačica poseduje i nekoliko spavaćih soba i kupatila na drugom spratu svoje raskošne kuće, te ne brine kada joj dođu gosti i članovi porodice jer ima dovoljno mesta da se svako od njih oseća komforno.

Teodora godinu dana uživa u ljubavi sa svojim izabranikom Maticom, a navodi se da su odlučili da svoju vezu podignu na viši nivo. Iako se pevačica trudi da privatan život sačuva daleko od očiju javnosti, izvor blizak poznatom paru priča da oni već neko vreme rade na prinovi. - Teodora i Matic su se stvarno pronašli, oni su jednostavno srodne duše, funkcionišu kao jedno. Zaista su skladan par, oko svega se dogovaraju i svađe kod njih su nepoznanica. Ona nikada nije bila ovako srećna i zaljubljena, procvetala je otkad je sa njim, puna je nekog novog elena. Odavno su započeli zajednički život, te sada priželjkuju bebu i već neko vreme rade na tome. Oboje su porodični tipovi i žele veliku porodicu. Teodora je oduvek maštala da postane mlada mama i sada je shvatila da je Matic taj kome želi da podari dete i da provede ostatak života sa njim - otkrio je izvor blizak paru, koji je insistirao na anonimnosti i dodao da je dolaskom Teodorine bratanice na svet proradio i njen majčinski instinkt: - Teodorin brat Sava i snajka Adrijana nedavno su postali roditelji, što je u Teodori na neki način probudilo želju da i ona i Matic osnuju porodicu. Često ih posećuje jer voli da provodi vreme sa bebom, kad god ima slobodnog vremena. Razmišlja o tome kakva će ona majka biti, da li će se snaći, ima strah, ali isto tako i veliku želju za potomstvom. Da je među pevačicom i slovenačkim košarkašem sve idilično, svedoči činjenica da su Teodorini roditelji upoznali budućeg zeta, kao i njegovi nju, te da su im obe porodice dale blagoslov. - Teodorin otac, mama Goca i brat Sava oduševljeni su njenim izborom, Matic ih je kupio neposrednošću, skromnošću, ali i načinom na koji tretira Teodoru. Najbitnije im je da je ona srećna i zadovoljna, a kraj njega zaista blista, to svi primećuju. Kako je još izvor rekao, iako Goca Džehverović obožava zeta, pomalo strahuje da bi njena ćerka zbog eventualne trudnoće u budućnosti mogla da zapostavi karijeru: - Goca ne bi imala ništa protiv kada bi joj ćerka rekla da se udaje, ali smatra da ne sme da zapostavi karijeru. Teodora joj stalno priča da joj je proradio majčinski instinkt, pa Goca brine da bi sav trud uložen u njenu dosadašnju karijeru mogao da padne u vodu. Samo za stan u luksuznom beogradskom naselju iskeširala je oko 250.000 evra, a o pesmama i spotovima da i ne govorimo. Ove tvrdnje potvrdila je i sama Teodora, priznavši da bi volela da se mlada ostvari u ulozi majke. - Oduvek mi je bila želja da budem mlada mama. Ne mogu da preciziram godine, jer su jedno želje, a drugo mogućnosti, to su stvari koje ne možemo planirati. Istina je da jedva čekam da postanem majka. Želim da se ostvarim i u poslovnom smislu, ali i kao majka i žena, smatram da je to veoma važno - rekla je nedavno Teodora, piše  .

To će biti jedan višeslojni oblik angažovanja regruta  prilikom služenja vojnog roka i mislim da je to i čast svih mladića koji će služiti vojni rok.  rekao je Vučević. Predsednik Srbije Aleksandar Vučić govorio je ranije o uvođenju vojnog roka u Srbiji u trajanju od 90 dana. - Obavezni vojni rok od 90 dana, a na nadležnim vojnim organima je da nam izvede računicu koliko bi to koštalo.   - uveren je Vučić. Obavezni vojni rok u Srbiji bio je suspendovan, a tome je ranije govorio Miloš Vučević. -  . Odluka o vraćanju vojnog roka nije doneta, ona zahteva ozbiljnu i stručnu analizu i ona se  . Imamo situacije sa elementarnim nepogodama – imamo poplave, požare, zemljotrese, smetove snega i svi tada očekuju od vojske ili policije da reaguju. Pre par nedelja bile su poplave u Raškoj, Novom Pazaru i Tutinu i ko je prvi tu bio, naravno vojska i policija. Svi kažu “bravo, momci!”, ali nema neograničenih resursa. To je odluka o kojoj treba razgovarati, ona se ne donosi preko noći, ali je niko nije doneo. Ako je problem da to pomenemo, onda hajde da ćutimo i da zabijemo glavu kao noj u pesak. Predložiću stručnu raspravu, da se o tome razgovara u narednom periodu - rekao je Vučević  . (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ).

Kako izveštava britanski „Daily Mail“ pozivajući se na Trampove insajdere, čini se da su dvoje vodećih menadžera kampanje na ivici. Suzi Vils (67) i Kris Lakivita (58) su  . Posebno „katastrofalni“ nastup u TV duelu protiv Kamale Harris (59) u utorak i odluka da Lumerove ne samo da prati Trampa u Filadelfiji, već i na  , prelila je čašu. Prema izvoru „Daily Mail-a“, bilo je uvredljivo što su omogućili „osobi koja negira 9/11 da uđe u avion 11. septembra“. Zbunjenost je očigledno eskalirala, a  . Razlog: Oni rade šta žele. I mogli su kao šefovi kampanje nešto da učine kako bi sprečili Lumerovu da dobije mesto u Trampovom avionu. Nekoliko sati pre TV debate, Lumerova je na platformi „X“ uputila na indijsko poreklo Kamale Harris i napisala da bi, ako demokratkinja pobedi na predsedničkim izborima u novembru, „Bela kuća mirisala na kari“ i da bi se govori u vladinoj zgradi „obavljali preko kol centra“. Lumer je, takođe, napisala i da migranti iz Haitija ne jedu samo pse i mačke: „Jedu ljude.“ U drugim objavama sugerisala je da su visoki američki zvaničnici bili umešani u napade 11. septembra 2001. godine i da je demokratski predsednik Džo Bajden (81) bio iza napada na Trampa, prenosi  . . - Ne znam mnogo o tome - rekao je 78-godišnji Tramp i dodao: - Ne znam šta je rekla, ali to nije moja stvar. Ne mogu Lori da kažem šta da radi.“ Kada je upitan o tome što ga je pratila u njegovom avionu, Tramp je odgovorio da to radi mnogo ljudi: „To je veliki avion.“ Kasnije je Tramp objavio saopštenje u kojem se donekle distancirao od Lumer: „ .\" I dodao: - Ne slažem se sa njenim izjavama, ali kao što je mnogo miliona ljudi koji me podržavaju, ona je umorna od gledanja kako radikalni levičari i marksisti nasilno napadaju i klevetaju mene, i čak čini sve što može da zaustavi svog političkog protivnika, MENE!

Uz sve to, Husina kaciga nije zadovoljavala sigurnosne standarde. Svima je zapalo za oko njegovo ponašanje tokom razgovora sa policajcem po imenu Deni. Naime, Huso je pokušao da se izvuče pričajući mešavinu bosanskog i engleskog jezika, ali mudra taktika mu nije prošla.  Dok je policajac, na engleskom jeziku, pokušao to objasniti starcu, ovaj ga je samo bledo gledao. - Kuda idete gospodine? Da li imate dozvolu? - pitao ga je policajac. - Nemam dozvolu, neregistrovan je. - Zašto onda vozite? I šta vam je to na glavi, šta je to? To nije kaciga za motor već za bicikl. Mogu li da vidim? Ukoliko padnete, ova kaciga vam neće pomoći. Možete poginuti - upozorio ga je čuvar reda. Potrudio se da objansi Husi da mu je odgovarajuća oprema neophodna za vožnju skutera, a  gospodin je to prihvatio s dozom sumnje. Dok je policajac pričao Huso je pokušao da upali motor i ode. - Ne možete nigde da idete, parkirajte skuter pored. Sačekajte trenutak, kažem vam. Molim Vas dajte mi dokumenta - nastavio je policajac. U tom trenutku policajac je pozvao nekoga da mu pomogne oko konverzacije, a kada mu je konačno objasnio čovek iz BiH nije imao kud. On je od nemoći počeo nešto da objašnjava i smekša policiju kako nebi dobio kaznu. - Ja sam Huso Sidran iz Hercegovinem, iz Bosne...Ma daj, bolan, pusti me u pi**u materinu. Ja ovako vozim 15 godina - nastavio je on. - No spik ingliš. Ne mogu, ne mogu.

U Rumuniji, meteorolozi su izdali narandžasta upozorenja za kišu i poplave, . Očekuju se intenzivne padavine sa rizikom od poplava i niskim temperaturama. U Italiji, turisti su bili iznenađeni slojem snega od oko 30 centimetara, dok je u Austriji snega bilo još više. U Češkoj i Poljskoj, ciklon donosi obilne kiše sa akumulacijama vode koje bi mogle dostići do 400 litara po kvadratnom metru. Vlasti se boje da bi poplave mogle biti uporedive sa razornim iz 1997. godine. U galeriji fotografija možete videti kakvo je trenutno stanje u Češkoj. Stanovništvu se savetuje da prati uputstva lokalnih vlasti i pripremi se za ekstremne vremenske uslove, koji bi mogli ozbiljno uticati na infrastrukturu i zajednice u pogođenim oblastima prenose rumunski mediji. Ciklon se kreće prema severu, severoistoku, zadržaće se neko vreme u Istočnoj Evropi, a zatim skrenuti prema zapadu. Ova situacija obično donosi obilne kiše, katastrofalnih razmera, rekao je Tomáš Hrdinka, hidrološkinja iz TGM istraživačkog instituta. Ciklon Boris, sistem niskog pritiska visoke intenziteta, bio je jedan od najznačajnijih vremenskih fenomena koji su pogodili regione u blizini Indijskog okeana. Formiran u ranoj fazi sezone ciklona,  Ciklon Boris formiran je u tropskom regionu Indijskog okeana, inicijalno kao oblast niskog pritiska. Povoljni uslovi, kao što su visoke temperature okeanske vode i povoljni vetrovi, pomogli su u njegovoj intensifikaciji, pretvarajući ga u snažan ciklon. Njegov put uključivao je prolazak kroz nekoliko ostrva i obalnih regiona, izazivajući zabrinutost i pripreme za hitne intervencije u pogođenim oblastima. Suočeni sa ciklonom takve magnitude, lokalne i međunarodne vlasti mobilisale su resurse za upravljanje vanrednom situacijom. Informativne kampanje i kampanje za rano upozorenje bile su ključne za pripremu stanovništva i smanjenje rizika. Nakon prolaska ciklona, sprovedene su operacije spasavanja i oporavka kako bi se pomoglo pogođenim zajednicama da se obnove. Pored toga, humanitarne organizacije i međunarodne agencije pružile su pomoć i resurse za podršku naporima obnove. Hrvatska konkretno nije prošla teško kao što je prošlo sedište Evrope, rekao je za 24sata glavni direktor DHMZ-a Ivan Güttler. Otkrio je da će subota, što se tiče padavina, biti nešto mirnija, dok se nastavak većih očekuje krajem današnjeg dana i u nedelju. - Treba obratiti pažnju na vetar, buru i severna strujanja. U Hrvatskoj će biti značajnih padavina, ali ništa alarmantno. Puno više pratimo šta se dešava u centralnoj Evropi, gde su zaista ekstremne količine padavina, pa će to povećati pritisak i na naše reke, prvenstveno mislim na Dunav - rekao je šef DHMZ-a. Republički hidrometeorološki zavod ( ) upozorio je na obilne padavine danas i sutra na širem području Srbije, kao i na jak i olujni vetar na području Vojvodine i Zapadne Srbije. Večeras i u toku noći, kao i sutra, na području Vojvodine, Mačve, Šumadije, kao i na teritoriji Beograda očekuje se veća količina padavina, od 20 do 40 mm za period od 24 -36 sati, a na području Braničevskog okruga, lokalno i preko 40 mm, navodi RHMZ. Krajem dana i u toku noći ka nedelji, na području Vojvodine i zapadne Srbije duvaće jak severozapadni vetar, koji će u nedelju imati udare olujne jačine.

Na taj način je praktično potvrdio da ta pomenuta povreda nije glavni razlog što je odbio da igra za Zmajeve protiv Holandije, što je izazvalo velike potrese kada je u pitanju sam Ahmedhodžić i reprezentacija.

Napad na nju i njenog saputnika dogodio se oko 18 časova po lokalnom vremenu na putu između grada Daule i grada Gvajakil, gde se nalazi Kazneno-popravni dom Litoral. Ikaza je išla ka bolnici Guasmo Sur, koja se nalazi na jugu Gvajakila, kada su, prema lokalnim medijima, naoružani napadači presreli vozilo i pucali na nju, dok je sedela na mestu suvozača. Prvobitno je SNAI izvestio da je Ikaza preživela i da je prebačena u bolnicu, ali je kasnije potvrđeno da je mrtva prenosi  . Ministarstvo unutrašnjih poslova izrazilo je žaljenje zbog njenog ubistva i uputilo saučešće njenim voljenima i prijateljima. Ovo je drugo ubistvo zatvorskog službenika u poslednjih devet dana, nakon što je Aleks Guevara, direktor zatvora Lago Agrio u amazonskoj provinciji Sucumbíos, ubijen u sličnim okolnostima 3. septembra. Kazneno-popravni dom Litoral, zvanično poznat kao Guayas Muški Centar za Lišenje Slobode Broj 1, je najveći od pet zatvora koji čine zatvorski kompleks u Gvajakilu i smešta oko 12.000 zatvorenika. Više od 6.000 zatvorenika se nalazi u Kazneno-popravnom domu Litoral, koji je između 2021. i 2023. godine bio mesto najgorih masakra izazvanih sukobima između kriminalnih bandi koje su se borile za unutrašnju kontrolu, bar do militarizacije ovih centara koju je na početku godine naredio predsednik Daniel Noboa. Ulazak vojske u zatvorske objekte deo je okvira vanrednog stanja i \"unutrašnjeg oružanog sukoba\" koji je predsednik proglasio protiv organizovanog kriminala, što se pripisuje porastu kriminalnog nasilja koje je dovelo Ekvador do toga da bude zemlja u Latinskoj Americi sa najvećom stopom ubistava. Tokom prošle godine je iznosila 47,2 na 100.000 stanovnika. Talasi ubistava prethodno je odneo živote i drugih zatvorskih direktora, kao i opštinskih vlasti, uključujući nekoliko gradonačelnika, i nacionalnih zvaničnika, kao što je predsednički kandidat Fernando Villavicencio. Ubistvo Marije Daniel Icaza je najnoviji događaj u krizi u zatvorima koju Ekvador doživljava od kraja 2020. godine, okarakterisana nasiljem bandi, neredima i direktnim napadima na zatvorske vlasti. 12. septembra dronom je bačena bomba na najzaštićeniji zatvor u Ekvadoru, La Roca. Detonacija je uništila krov zatvora, što je dovelo do evakuacije zatvorenika i premeštanja Hosea Adolfa Maciasa Villamara (Fito), vođe najveće i najstarije kriminalne bande Ekvadora - Los Choneros. 3. oktobra ubijen je čuvar u zatvoru \"El Rodeo\", smeštenom u glavnom gradu priobalne provincije Manabí.7. oktobra šest kolumbijskih ubica, za koje se sumnja da su učestvovali u ubistvu predsedničkog kandidata Fernanda Villavicencia, pronađeni su obešeni u Kazneno-popravnom domu Litoral, dok je drugi optuženik u istom slučaju ubijen u zatvoru El Inca u Quitu.8. novembra Fredi Ančundia, identifikovan od strane vlasti kao vođa kriminalne bande poznate kao 'R7' i optužen za izazivanje nekih od zatvorskih masakara koji su se dogodili u Ekvadoru prethodnih godina, pronađen je obešen u Regionalnom zatvoru u Gvajakilu .27. novembra jedan od zatvorenika ubija drugog tokom nereda u zatvoru Lago Agrio, nakon što je objekat napadnut eksplozivnom napravom ispaljenom iz drona. 7. januara potvrđeno je bekstvo 'Fita' iz Regionalnog zatvora u Gvajakilu 8. januara počinje niz simultanih nereda u zatvorima koje kontroliše kriminalna banda Los Lobos, sa oko 200 talaca, uključujući policajce, čuvare i zatvorske zvaničnike, koji su trajali oko nedelju dana. Najmanje dvojica zatvorenika i jedan čuvar su ubijeni, dok je oko stotinu zatvorenika u bekstvu 15. januara je počela militarizacija zatvora, koju je naredio predsednik Daniel Noboa u okviru vanrednog stanja i \"unutrašnjeg oružanog sukoba\" proglašenog protiv organizovanog kriminala, s ciljem preuzimanja kontrole nad zatvorima od bandi i oduzimanja njihovih oružja, pri čemu se beleže pritužbe na kršenje ljudskih prava.16. januara je ubijen zatvorski čuvar u amazonskom gradu Lago Agrio. 28. marta u neredima u regionalnm zatvoru u Gvajakilu ubijena su tri zatvorenika, a šestoro drugih je povređeno.21. aprila direktor zatvora El Rodeo je ubijen tokom dana glasanja za referendum koji je sazvao predsednik Daniel Noboa kako bi odobrio reforme za jačanje borbe protiv organizovanog kriminala, uključujući povećane vojne kontrole oko zatvora.1. maja izbila je humanitarna kriza u zatvorima. Izveštaji ljudskopravaških organizacija upozoravaju na ozbiljnu humanitarnu krizu u ekvadorskim zatvorima, ukazujući na nedostatak pristupa pijaćoj vodi, hrani i adekvatnoj medicinskoj nezi za zatvorenike. 22. jula naoružana grupa upala je u zdravtsveni centar u Gvajakilu kako bi omogućila bekstvo četvorici od pet zatvorenika koji su trebali da prime medicinsku pomoć.31. avgusta dva čuvara koja su radila u Litoralu su ubijena u Gvajakilu. 3. septembra direktor zatvora Lago Agrio u amazonijskoj provinciji Sucumbíos ubijen je u napadu, u kojima su druga dva zatvorska radnika povređena. 5. septembra, po drugi put u manje od godinu dana, bačena je bomba dronom na krov zatvora La Roca. 12. septembra direktor Kazneno-popravnog doma Litoral ubijen je u napadu koji se pripisuje kriminalnim bandama koje deluju unutar i van zatvorskog sistema.

Spasilačke službe borile su se da spasu 95 ljudi u teško pogođenim istočnim okruzima Galati i Vaslui, saopštilo je Odeljenje za vanredne situacije ne navodeći detalje o načinu smrti preminulih, prenosi AP. Helikopter \"Blek hok\" (Black Hawk) raspoređen je u Galati kako bi pomogao u misijama potrage i spasavanja. Nevreme je pogodilo 19 mesta u osam okruga u Rumuniji, a jak vetar je oborio desetine stabala koja su oštetila automobile i blokirala puteve i saobraćaj. Rumunski premijer Marsel Čolaku otkazao je planirane aktivnosti kako bi otputovao u okrug Galati i procenio posledice. Nadležne službe u nekoliko zemalja centralne Evrope saopštile su da će za vikend jake poplave pogoditi Češku, Poljsku, Austriju, Nemačku, Slovačku i Mađarsku. \"Moramo biti spremni za najgori scenario. Težak vikend je pred nama\", rekao je češki premijer Petr Fiala nakon sastanka vladinog centralnog kriznog komiteta. U Poljskoj, premijer Donald Tusk otputovao je juče u jugozapadni grad Vroclav, gde se predviđaju poplave. Ciklon se kreće prema severu, severoistoku, zadržaće se neko vreme u Istočnoj Evropi, a zatim skrenuti prema zapadu. Ova situacija obično donosi obilne kiše, katastrofalnih razmera, rekao je Tomáš Hrdinka, hidrološkinja iz TGM istraživačkog instituta. Ciklon Boris, sistem niskog pritiska visoke intenziteta, bio je jedan od najznačajnijih vremenskih fenomena koji su pogodili regione u blizini Indijskog okeana. Formiran u ranoj fazi sezone ciklona,  Ciklon Boris formiran je u tropskom regionu Indijskog okeana, inicijalno kao oblast niskog pritiska. Povoljni uslovi, kao što su visoke temperature okeanske vode i povoljni vetrovi, pomogli su u njegovoj intensifikaciji, pretvarajući ga u snažan ciklon. Njegov put uključivao je prolazak kroz nekoliko ostrva i obalnih regiona, izazivajući zabrinutost i pripreme za hitne intervencije u pogođenim oblastima. Suočeni sa ciklonom takve magnitude, lokalne i međunarodne vlasti mobilisale su resurse za upravljanje vanrednom situacijom. Informativne kampanje i kampanje za rano upozorenje bile su ključne za pripremu stanovništva i smanjenje rizika. Nakon prolaska ciklona, sprovedene su operacije spasavanja i oporavka kako bi se pomoglo pogođenim zajednicama da se obnove. Pored toga, humanitarne organizacije i međunarodne agencije pružile su pomoć i resurse za podršku naporima obnove.

Danima berbe grožđa u Vršcu. Njen nastup privukao je veliko interesovanje obožavalaca iz regiona, posebno iz susedne Rumunije, gde se ova muzička ikona posebno poštuje. Iz susedne zemlje, najavljen je dolazak na koncert čak 61 autobusa. Zanimljivo je da to nisu autobusi koji će doći iz Temišvara, nego iz drugih gradova, a iz Temišvara, koji je od Vršca udaljen oko 70 kilometara, očekuje se najmanje još toliko gostiju. Lokalna samouprava u Vršcu uspešno se dogovorila sa najvećom zvezdom na prostoru Balkana, pa će Lepa Brena pevati 15. septembra. Pored posetilaca iz Rumunije, očekuje se i oko 10.000 posetilaca iz svih ostalih krajeva jer Brenini koncerti su spektakl. Lepa Brena je preko 40 godina na sceni. Iza sebe ima brojne uspehe, koncerte na punim stadionima, arene, filmove koji se sa istim žarom emituju i gledaju i dan danas, ima najtiražnije albume, velike turneje… I sve je to samo deo onog što čini karijeru naše poznate pevačice. Oriće se Vršcem hitovi poput: Duge noge, Došlo vreme da se pođe, Bato Bato, Bice Belaja, Danas plačem ja a sutra ćeš ti, Sitnije Cile sitnije, Boli me uvo za sve, Ja nemam drugi dom, Kuća laži, Pazi kome zavidiš, Kralj, Sledeći, Četiri godine, Dama Iz Londona, Dečko mi je školarac… i još mnogi drugi.

Posledice će biti neverovatne - Nauka Telegraf", "Author Name": null, "Author URL": null, "Article Content": "Vreme čitanja: oko 5 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 5 min. Zamislite   koji otkucava tako precizno da ne gubi ni sekund, čak ni nakon što radi milijardu godina. Naučnici su sada bliži nego ikad ostvarivanju tog nivoa preciznosti u merenju vremena, pokazuje novo istraživanje, prenosi CNN. Takav uređaj bi daleko nadmašio mogućnosti atomskih satova, koji definišu trajanje jedne sekunde kroz kontrolisane energetske skokove u elektronima atoma i trenutno predstavljaju vrhunac preciznosti u merenju vremena. U atomskim satovima, signali koji pobuđuju atome osciluju na frekvenciji od milijardi puta u sekundi. Istraživači su nedavno razvili tehniku koja bi mogla podići ovu preciznost, izazivajući i mereći oscilacije u još složenijem cilju: jezgru atoma. Za ovaj nuklearni sat, naučnici su koristili ultraljubičasto svetlo kako bi pobudili nuklearne čestice u atomu torijuma-229 ugrađenom u čvrstu kristalnu strukturu. Zatim su merili frekvenciju energetskih impulsa koji utiču na jezgro — ekvivalent klatnu u običnom satu — brojeći talase u UV signalu pomoću alata zvanog \"češalj optičke frekvencije\". Izazivanje energetskih skokova u jezgru zahteva signal znatno veće frekvencije nego kod atomskih satova. Sa više ciklusa talasa u sekundi, ovaj pristup bi trebalo da omogući preciznije merenje vremena. I dok je nuklearni sat još u razvoju, jednom kada bude realizovan, mogao bi transformisati ne samo merenje vremena, već i proučavanje fizike, pa čak i uticati na način na koji naučnici istražuju strukturu Svemira. Prototip je već jednako precizan kao atomski sat, a očekuje se da buduće verzije budu još preciznije i stabilnije, prema istraživanju objavljenom 4. septembra u časopisu \"Nature\". Sada kada su istraživači pokazali da je moguće proizvesti i meriti ove signale, \"postoji mnogo stvari koje možemo unaprediti kako bismo dodatno povećali tačnost\", rekao je glavni autor studije Čuankun Žang, student postdiplomskih studija u JILA — zajedničkom istraživačkom centru koji finansiraju Univerzitet Kolorado u Bolderu i Nacionalni institut za standarde i tehnologiju. Na primer, Žang je rekao za CNN, prilagođavanja bi mogla uključivati podešavanje usklađenosti i frekvencije lasera koji pobuđuju jezgro. - Ovaj rad zaista označava početak nuklearnog sata - rekla je dr Olga Kočarovskaja, istaknuti profesor fizike na Univerzitetu Texas A&M, koja nije bila uključena u istraživanje. U 2023. godini, Kočarovskaja i drugi istraživači testirali su jezgra atoma skandijuma-45 kao moguće kandidate za nuklearni sat. Tada su ti atomi proizveli najsnažniji energetski prelaz — i merljiv impuls — ikada viđen u jezgru, ali novi rezultati iz torijuma-229 generisali su snažniji signal i bili stabilniji, rekla je Kočarovskaja za CNN. „Šire značenje je u poverenju koje ovaj rad daje realnosti nuklearnog sata“, rekla je. „Ne ostavlja sumnje da je takav sat izvodljiv i da će uskoro biti napravljen.“ U atomskim satovima, elektroni atoma bivaju pobuđeni elektromagnetnim zračenjem na određenim frekvencijama. Energetski impulsi pobuđuju elektrone, pomerajući ih u višu orbitu oko atoma. Oscilacije koje pokreću prelaz elektrona između stanja označavaju protok vremena, prema NASA-i. Pouzdanost atomskih satova daleko je veća nego kod svakodnevnih satova koji mere sekunde kroz vibracije kvarcnih kristala, koji su skloni gubitku sinhronizacije. Decenijama se atomski satovi koriste u GPS tehnologijama, za istraživanje svemira i održavanje međunarodnog vremena. Međutim, atomski satovi su takođe podložni gubitku sinhronizacije. Elektromagnetni poremećaji mogu ometati pobuđene elektrone i uticati na preciznost merenja vremena, rekao je Zhang. Čestice u atomskoj jezgri, s druge strane, teže je \"uznemiriti\" nego elektrone. Protoni i neutroni su čvrsto vezani jakom nuklearnom silom — najjačom od svih osnovnih sila. Talasne dužine koje mogu izazvati prelaz u jezgri osciluju na višim frekvencijama, omogućavajući preciznije merenje vremena, naveli su istraživači. Pre ovog istraživanja, postignuti su značajni koraci u razvoju nuklearnih satova. Prvi, 1976. godine, bio je otkriće da jezgro torijuma ima „jedinstveno nisku energiju“ i da se može pobuditi pomoću vakuumskog ultraljubičastog (VUV) laserskog svetla. Do 2003. godine, naučnici su predlagali da bi torijum, jer zahteva manje energije za pobuđivanje jezgra nego većina drugih tipova atoma, mogao biti dobar kandidat za nuklearne satove, prema studiji. U 2023. godini, naučnici su razvili metodu za ugradnju torijuma-229 u kristale; ovaj čvrst sistem suprimirao je signale nuklearne dezintegracije, čineći željene signale lakšim za praćenje. Ranije ove godine, drugi istraživači su izmerili talasnu dužinu svetla potrebnu za pobuđivanje jezgra torijuma-229. „Naš rad se nadovezuje na to“, rekao je Žang. „Uz naš izvor svetlosti sa frekventnim češljem i ovaj kristal, uspeli smo da pobudimo nuklearni prelaz i različite prelazne energije.“ Njihovi rezultati su bili približno milion puta precizniji od prethodnih merenja, dodao je Žang. „Ova studija je pravi podvig“, rekao je dr Šimon Kolkovic, vanredni profesor i šef katedre za fiziku na Univerzitetu Kalifornije, Berkli. „Kvalitet podataka i brzina kojom su postigli zapanjujuće rezultate u ovom novom rukopisu zaista su neverovatni“, rekao je Kolkovic, koji nije učestvovao u istraživanju. „Ovo predstavlja veliki korak napred u razvoju nuklearnih satova, na kojima fizičari rade decenijama.“ Preciznost i stabilnost atomskih satova već su omogućile naučnicima važne alate za proučavanje zemljotresa, gravitacionih polja i prostor-vremena. Ove oblasti bi mogle doživeti „veliki napredak“ zahvaljujući nuklearnim satovima, rekla je Kočarovskaja. Nuklearni satovi bi bili ne samo precizniji, već i jednostavniji i prenosiviji, jer za razliku od atomskih satova, ne bi zahtevali visoke vakuumske uslove, ekstremno hlađenje i snažno zaštitu od magnetnih i električnih smetnji, dodala je. Sama studija fizike mogla bi biti revolucionisana upotrebom nuklearnih satova zajedno sa atomskim satovima, prema Žangu. Praćenje i poređenje odnosa frekvencija između dve vrste satova tokom vremena moglo bi pomoći naučnicima da utvrde da li su osnovne fizičke konstante zaista konstantne ili se menjaju na nivoima koji su ranije bili previše minijaturni da bi se merili, rekao je |ang. Ova tehnika uparivanja satova mogla bi biti revolucionarna za proučavanje tamne materije, misteriozne supstance koja čini 80% svemira, ali nikada nije direktno izmerena, dodao je. Neki naučnici su dali hipotezu da tamna materija stupa u interakciju sa česticama kao što su elektroni, kvarkovi i gluoni, ali u količinama koje su trenutno nedetektabilne. „Želimo da vidimo da li tamna materija može na neki način interagovati sa jezgrom atoma na drugačiji način u poređenju sa orbitom elektrona u atomu“, rekao je |hang. „Ako se odnos frekvencija prelaza nuklearnog sata i atomskog sata menja tokom vremena, to bi bio pokazatelj nove fizike.“ Iako ima još mnogo napretka pre nego što nuklearni satovi nadmaše performanse atomskih satova — ili ih zamene — ova otkrića nagoveštavaju da takvo vreme nije daleko, rekao je Kolkovic. „Kako se razvijaju bolji izvori UV lasera i kako se otkriju neki od trikova nuklearnih satova, očekujem da će na kraju neka od vrsta eksperimenata koje trenutno radimo u mojoj laboratoriji za testiranje relativnosti i traženje nove fizike sa atomskim satovima umesto toga biti izvedena sa nuklearnim satovima“, rekao je Kolkovic.

U videu od 45 minuta koje je za nekoliko sati pogledala desetina hiljada ljudi, čuveni Vova je obišao delove Beograda koji nisu turistički -  buvljake, nehigijenska naselja, divlje deponije. Prčao je i o sukobima Srba sa pridošlim Rusima, zamerkama koje dobijaju, automobilima na ulicama koje je opisao rečju \"smeće\", bučnim komšijama u zgradama, lenjim srpskim radnicima i mnogo čemu drugom. Neki će reći da je preterao, a neko da je ukazao na naše nedostatke i minuse. Mnogi Rusi su mu se požalili da ih Srbi kritikuju što se ne integrišu, a jedan od Rusa u snimku, koje je jutjuber intervjuisao, bio je šokiran prizorom sa buvljaka -   tvrdi da je tamo video veštačku vaginu. Komentari na snimak su raznovrsni - od \"ahahahaha, za 550 evra iznajmljuju ovu štalu sa psima u dvorištu i bubašvabama?! Bože, kako nas muzu, ljudi deluju OK, ali kako pristati na takve uslove?\" \"Selektivno negativno subjektivno iskustvo više ljudi. Odvratno. Ovde se uopšte ne radi o Srbiji\", glasio je drugi komentar. \"Momci kojima su po želji isključili muziku imali su veliku sreću. Normalno je da se ovde postavljaju koncertne ulične zvučnike i pali turbo-folk po celoj ulici (da se čuje kilometar unaokolo) cele noći. Došli smo do njih i zamolili ih da utišaju oko ponoći, kada smo shvatili da niko neće zaustaviti zabavu - gledali su nas potpuno bez razumevanja :). Rekli su dođi kod nas na rakiju, rođendan nam je. Bili smo kao - ehhh, napolju je noć, stišaj, ne. Na kraju, žurka je trajala do 2 sata ujutru, dok neko od meštana nije izdržao i pozvao policiju, svaka čast, došli su, ne baš brzo, ali su došli. Ove komšije nas sada ne pozdravljaju, jer misle da smo mi zvali policiju...\", opisao je drugi Rus svoje muke u komentarima. Šta vi mislite?

Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. , koje se suočava sa velikim  Nemački kancelar Olaf Šolc rekao je na zajedničkoj konferenciji za novinare u Berlinu sa kenijskim predsednikom Vilijamom Rutom da zahvaljujući ovom sporazumu, kvalifikovani radnici će moći da dođu u Nemačku, a mladi ljudi će moći da dođu na studije. Prema rečima kancelara, ova saradnja može pomoći u ublažavanju nedostatka radne snage, čiji efekti su već osetni u nemačkoj ekonomiji, izveštava MTI, a prenosi  . - Osnova naše sreće je to što smo otvoreni prema svetu, i moramo očuvati to - izjavio je Šolc, dodajući da je, pored otvorenosti, veoma važno jasno ograničiti ilegalnu imigraciju. Nemački kancelar je rekao da sporazum takođe obezbeđuje da se oni koji nezakonito borave u Nemačkoj mogu efikasnije da se vrate u Keniju. Viliam Ruto pohvalio je \"ogroman ljudski kapital\", inovativnu snagu i kreativnost svoje zemlje. Istakao je da je prosečna starost stanovništva u Keniji 20 godina. Nemačka vlada je već potpisala slične sporazume o migraciji sa Indijom, Marokom i Gruzijom, a sledeće nedelje će potpisati ugovor sa Uzbekistanom. Takođe se priprema slična saradnja sa Moldavijom, Kirgistanom i Filipinima. Prema  , Kenija ima 56.658.088 stanovnika. Prosečna plata u Keniji varira u zavisnosti od nekoliko faktora kao što je iskustvo, industrija u kojoj radi, kao i na kojoj lokaciji ali i nivo obrazovanja. Prosečna mesečna plata u Keniji, u različitim sektorima, procenjuje se između 30.000 i 130.000 kenijskih šilinga (KES) mesečno piše na sajtu  . Ovakav potez se verovatno može osetiti i na koži naših gastarbajtera, jer sada u Nemačku stiže radna snaga koja je radila za 200 evra mesečno! Inače, pretpostavlja se da u Nemačkoj živi između 400.000 i 800.000 Srba. Podsetimo, Nemci su 1. juna uveli novi zakon o useljavanju kvalifikovanih radnika, koji ima za cilj da privuče više kvalifikovanih radnika iz zemalja koje nisu članice EU-a, što je i te kako značajno za Srbiju. Prema podacima iz avgusta, tzv. kartice prilike izdato je skoro 200 viza po ovoj pravnoj osnovi, navelo je tada Ministarstvo spoljnih poslova. Postoje i poeni za kvalifikacije u deficitarnim zanimanjima. Svako ko ima dovoljan broj poena može doći u Nemačku i onda ima godinu dana da traži stalni posao. Pod određenim uslovima moguće je jednokratno produženje za dve godine. (Telegraf Biznis) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ).

It is supposed to reflect the health of the listed universe of Indian companies, and hence the broader economy, in all market conditions. Officially called the Nifty50, the index is computed using the free float market capitalisation method, which is essentially the count of shares in active circulation in the market at any given point of time. The Nifty, just like BSE benchmark Sensex, is today used for benchmarking portfolios and returns of mutual fund schemes and launching index funds. The Nifty index was launched on April 22, 1996, with a base value of 1,000 counted from November 3, 1995. Live Nifty quotes are available on NSEIndia.com, ETMarkets.com and numerous other web platforms and TV channels at any point of time. The Nifty brand and indices are managed by the Mumbai-based India Index Services and Products Limited, IISL in short, which itself is a subsidiary of NSE. IISL has a three-tier governance structure comprising the board of directors, the index policy committee and the index maintenance sub-committee. IISL managed some 67 indices under the Nifty brand as of September 30, 2016. IISL rebalances the Nifty index semi-annually. The cut-off dates for the semi-annual review of the index are January 31 and July 31 each year. Average data for the six months ending the cut-off date is considered. The exchange notifies any change in the index four weeks before such changes take effect. There are defined eligibility criteria for selection of Nifty constituent stocks. The liquidity of a stock is measured by the market impact cost, which is essentially the cost involved in transacting a stock. For a stock to qualify for inclusion in the Nifty50, it must have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less for six months and for 90 per cent of observation cases. Besides, the company must have a listing history of at least six months. However, a newly-listed company, which has just got listed through the IPO route, may become eligible for inclusion in the index, if it fulfils the normal eligibility criteria for a three- month period instead of six months. Only those stocks which are eligible for trade in the F&O segment of NSE are considered for inclusion as Nifty constituents. As of September 20, 2017, the Nifty had 35.73 per cent components from the financial services sector, 14 per cent from the energy sector, 11.46 per cent from the information technology sector, 10.64 per cent from the automobile sector and 10.13 per cent from the consumer goods sector. Six of the nine BFSI companies in the Nifty50 were private banks. The Nifty index also has several variants such as Nifty Junior, Nifty50 USD, Nifty50 Total Returns index and NIFTY50 Dividend Points Index. BROWSE COMPANIES:",

The rush for such small SUVs underscores a broader shift towards SUVs from traditional cars in the world’s third-largest automobile market.

Donald Trump has proposed granting automatic green cards to foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges, marking a significant shift in his immigration stance. This move aims to retain top global talent and could greatly benefit Indian students who face uncertainty about their post-graduation status in the U.S. The October 2024 U.S. Visa Bulletin shows progress in most employment-based categories, with significant advancements in the EB-3 Worldwide category. USCIS will accept adjustment of status applications based on the dates for filing chart. The bulletin also reflects the culmination of fiscal year 2024 visa limits, impacting many applicants' immigration processes. Eligible foreign nationals facing financial hardship after the death of a partner can soon apply to have their UK settlement application fee waived. This new rule, effective from October 9, aims to provide a fairer and more compassionate approach for those dealing with grief and financial vulnerability.

    "Article Content": ": ASIRT is a unique association with a genuine bonding amongst the members. The bonding goes beyond business and connects each other emotionally as well. The consortium concept within ASIRT gives the members to further deepen the bonding amongst the members. They are active participant in every activity whether it is fun, sports, arts, knowledge, spiritual practices etc. It’s a pleasure to be part of ASIRT, and I’m proud to be a key sponsor for 'The Synergy Biz Conclave 2024' —it’s truly an honor for me. : I am a first-generation entrepreneur and have been honest and driven. While business is important, I focus more on how I can grow as a person. Business, profitability, and making a living will follow naturally. I’m happy to have built something from the ground up, starting from zero. Also, I am looking far beyond this business as well. :  Yes, my son completed his MBA from NMIMS, and has joined Bluecom to support the growth of our dream company. Since the industry is going through a transformation phase, I am happy to see him lead many efforts to grow further. Today, it’s all about a solution-centric approach. Customers no longer want just products; they want comprehensive solutions. This shift is something I expect him to drive within the company. He has the bandwidth to keep up with the latest technology. He is grooming and learning new technologies and initiatives in the market to integrate with his existing portfolio of products. I am looking forward to him as we will reach to new heights under the leadership of the new generation.  : Without their support and confidence, Bluecom would not have reached where it is now. Distribution is Bluecom’s one of the strongest verticals. This is the comprehensive approach that we have reached in the distribution vertical this far. In a highly competitive market like Mumbai, where we focus on niche Lenovo products in distribution, we've managed to reach nearly 550 unique partners in a single quarter which is humungous. To date, we've built relationships with over 8,000 unique partners, demonstrating the kind of market coverage we have. We've been able to succeed because we don’t approach sales in the typical way. For instance, even after six months, if there's an issue with a product, we've offered reversals and ensured service is provided. We’re clearly on the right path, and I’m excited for what’s ahead.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

    "Author Name": null,
    "Author URL": null,
    "Article Content": "Huawei Technologies unveiled its latest $2,800 tri-fold smartphone on Tuesday, aiming to strengthen its position in the world’s largest smartphone market and draw attention away from Apple, just hours after Apple's latest iPhone 16 launch. The Chinese technology company exhibited the latest Mate XT, a three-way foldable handset such as an accordion screen door, in the Shenzhen tech hub launch ceremony. The smartphone has already received over 4 million pre-orders that required no deposit, as per the company’s website. According to research organization IDC, the entire global market for foldable phones, in the second quarter, was around 4 million units. The world’s first triple foldable phone has arrived. Breaking boundaries and redefining possibilities. Delivering an immersive and dynamic experience completely unlike anything you have ever imagined.      \"Today we bring you a product that everyone can think of but could not make. Our team has been working hard for five years and has never given up,\" Richard Yu, Huawei executive director stated at the launch. \"Today we will once again rewrite the history of the industry, turn science fiction into reality, and lead a new era of folding devices.\" AI functions are bolstered with in-house Kylin chips of Huawei, he added. The new phone features an AI assistant alongside translation, text summary, and editing functions, along with AI-boosted image editing capabilities such as removing unwanted parts from the photos, Yu said. The highly anticipated launch follows right hours after Apple introduced its latest lineup - the AI-supported iPhone 16, both smartphones are due to up on sale on 20  September. The Mate XT is available in red and black colours and boasts a 10.2-inch display screen. The company claims that its 3.6mm width makes it the slimmest foldable phone in the world and also has a keyboard attached easy to fit in the pocket. The 256-gigabyte model is priced at 19,999 yuan, with higher memory options available at 21,999 yuan and 23,999 yuan, as per Reuters. The launch, following a string of successful smartphone releases, highlights Huawei's resilience in overcoming U.S. sanctions and strengthens its position over Apple in China, where consumers have criticized the iPhone 16 for lacking AI features. Apple is still in search of an AI partner in China to enhance its iPhone 16 series, while its AI software, Apple Intelligence, will not be available in Chinese languages until next year.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

    "Author URL": null,
    "Article Content": "We have been contributing to the education industry for a while now, and it was our vision from the beginning to develop our own writing board software with all the latest features. This idea has been with us since we started the operations of our company almost five years ago. Today, I am very happy to say that it has finally been accomplished. This is our contribution to the nation, demonstrating that we are not dependent on any other country for software solutions; we have created our own. 'Mannat' Writing Board software is going to revolutionize the industry as it is the first software integrated with inbuilt content for everything. Currently, we have added NCERT content and plan to include ICSE board content and other curricula. We also aim to convert the content videos into 14 regional languages, making it accessible to a wider audience. Our goal is to make digital teaching available on all panels so that everyone can benefit from it. Over the past 25 years, since the advent of smart classes, there has always been a challenge of using different software for content and writing boards, causing confusion among teachers. With five years of hard work, we have finally integrated a whiteboard with content, making it user-friendly and easy for teachers to use. Before launching, we took feedback from over 200 to 500 teachers by showing them free demos and organizing classes to understand their needs and preferences. Based on their feedback, we have included mathematical tools, chemistry tools, physics tools, images, videos, books, PPTs, 3D images, and more. Previously, various software offered limited features, but now we have consolidated everything into one software, making it a win-win situation for us. As industry leaders, we wanted a leading personality to represent our brand. We didn't want someone who plays a secondary or tertiary role; we wanted a hero. Abhay Deol perfectly fits this image. Additionally, he was my daughter's choice as well, which made the decision even more meaningful. We initially discussed the idea with him last year, and after waiting for a year, we are finally able to bring this collaboration. This product is not only compatible with our hardware, but anyone, any brand, can purchase and use it with their hardware. The idea is that the future battle lies in software, not hardware. While hardware is common among people, software presents a challenge. We have taken the initiative, as we always do, because we are the leaders and must act as such. Others had an equal opportunity to do so, but no one took advantage of it. We believe we have been blessed to do it. The first version is already available, and every month, users will receive a new update. We aim to achieve a market share of 30 to 40% in next one year. In August, we are launching the Android version as well, so anyone can use it on Android or Windows. Initially, we are collaborating with our partners and all the brands associated with us. We provide them with our software, which they can sell under their own branding. We are also offering this as a white-label solution. I believe that within the next year, most brands will be associated with our software and will adopt it. Just like in all government projects where the government has mandated the use of Indian software and products, they require software for both Android and Windows platforms, and both should be the same. I think we will be the only company in India to have this capability. No other company offers software for both Windows and Android with the same specifications and features. While many Chinese companies are doing this, they face restrictions from the government. Therefore, I believe that India will be the only country where a manufacturer will have both Android and Windows versions with the same specs and features. The digital revolution is underway, and we are committed to contributing our best efforts to it. We are not leading a revolution but are merely playing a part in it, striving to add our numbers and efforts to the cause. The success of our contribution relies on the support and love from people and the guidance of God. I promise to India that this year, we will have India's largest IT manufacturing facility in Punjab. We have already acquired the land, and the construction work is underway. This year, we promise to have the largest manufacturing unit in India, located in Punjab. We have already initiated many steps in this direction, and I believe we will be able to start the factory around Diwali. This will be our gift to India. We are also exporting our software application. We have orders from Dubai, and many customers from Dubai are interested. Even our vendors, from whom we buy raw materials, are willing to buy the software under their name. However, my idea was to start from India. Once the software gains popularity in India, we can then expand to other countries. We have already developed a website for online purchases. People can buy online from our Dubai office. We are open to customization requests as well, and we can tailor the software to meet specific needs.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

The research surveyed 555 software executives around the world whose companies span IT consultancy services, manufacturing, banking, financial services and insurance among others. 84 percent of respondents reported that their organizations first began to incorporate AI technologies in their SDLCs between six months to five years ago, with the earliest adopters primarily being IT services companies. Across regions, EMEA and North America remain roughly on equal footing, while APAC is steadily catching up. The findings show that testing, quality assurance, and security vulnerability detection are by far the most widely adopted use cases for AI in software development. Nonetheless, generative AI (GenAI) is set to transform the industry by significantly enhancing these processes and introducing unprecedented capabilities. Early adopters are planning to increase their use of AI in other stages of the SDLC, such as user interface design, code generation, DevOps optimization, and application maintenance. Nearly all respondents are planning to increase their investment in AI-augmented SDLC management over the next two years, indicating that AI will play a central role in driving innovation and competitive advantage in the software industry. “AI is redefining the impossible,” said Paulo Rosado, CEO and founder at OutSystems. “I’m laser-focused on helping teams compress multi-year legacy modernization projects into just a few months. The latest AI disruptions have brought us the potential to compress these development timelines into even shorter and faster projects. With AI, historically impossible transformation projects are not only possible but easier, cheaper, and faster to accomplish.” “Right now, the developer’s role is shifting from code writer to code reviewer,” said Rodrigo Coutinho, Co-founder and AI Project Manager at OutSystems. “Large language models (LLMs) are a big help, but they still make mistakes. But as these models evolve, and trust in the resulting code improves, the developer’s role will be more akin to that of an orchestrator and acceptance tester of AI-generated outputs.” Despite being a nascent technology a couple of years ago, the report found that confidence in the quality of AI-generated code has risen substantially—half of respondents said that the implementation of AI has improved software quality, enhanced decision-making, and increased efficiency in software testing and quality assurance. But confidence is also paired with risk awareness surrounding tech debt in the form of orphan code and hallucinations, a lack of context for an organization’s specific coding needs, and scalability concerns. With strategy baked into AI in SDLC processes, 56% of respondents said they experienced or expected to experience a higher quality of applications, with fewer bugs and improved performance.   The AI opportunity is undeniably huge, but its wider adoption in other areas of the SDLC beyond software testing and vulnerability detection still face some barriers. Chief among these are data privacy and security concerns (56% of respondents) and regulatory and compliance challenges (42%). Moreover, 38% of executives cite difficulties integrating generative AI into existing workflows as the primary barrier to adoption. “There’s a lot of speculation on what will change with the rise of GenAI,” said Michael Harper, Managing Director at KPMG U.S. “While there will be challenges, those with effective change management initiatives will reskill and upskill their workforces, leading to AI and jobs evolving in tandem.” The speed and sprawl of AI, namely GenAI, is paving the way for an increase in investments for nearly all respondents. But risks concerning the reliability of AI-generated code persist, though they can be mitigated with existing approaches, such as user acceptance testing, unit testing, and regression testing. “It’s up to the developer working with AI to guarantee the quality of the deliverables, but this becomes way more efficient with AI,” said Coutinho. “AI is, in fact, a great partner in creating tests in synthetic data.” Other oft-cited concerns were the limited availability of skilled personnel and difficulties integrating GenAI into existing tech stacks and workflows. Fears of job losses are high as well, with 89% of respondents claiming that certain roles will be eliminated by AI. This falls in line with a broader industry trend over the last couple of years. However, in the longer term, AI may well create more jobs than it displaces, resulting in a new type of developer, equipped with specialized AI skill sets.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

    "Article Content": "Since 2014, we have proudly led the Indian market in high-brightness projection segment, consistently maintaining our position at the forefront with products that exceed 6000 lumens. Our journey in innovation doesn’t stop there; we are continuously advancing in the realm of direct view LED displays. To date, we have successfully completed over 200 installations across India, demonstrating our commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. One of our most groundbreaking achievements is the introduction of our MicroTiles LED. This product represents a significant leap forward in direct view LED technology, offering unique features and unparalleled performance that set it apart in the industry. Our dedication to innovation and quality ensures that we not only meet but exceed the expectations of our clients, solidifying our reputation as a leader in high-brightness and direct view LED solutions in India. Today, we proudly offer what is possibly the largest range of DLP projectors available from any manufacturer, with units spanning from 5,000 to 50,000 lumens. However, our expertise extends far beyond projectors alone. We have distinguished ourselves by providing comprehensive integrated solutions that cater to diverse customer needs. Products like Pandoras Box, Terra, and Mystique exemplify our commitment to delivering turnkey solutions, solidifying Christie's reputation as a one-stop solutions provider. Projection technology continues to play a crucial role in immersive entertainment due to its unparalleled flexibility, seamlessly adapting to both indoor and outdoor environments. Looking ahead, we envision an even tighter integration of projectors with advanced content management and processing solutions, such as our Pandoras Box. This product is specifically designed for immersive environments, ensuring a cohesive and captivating experience for audiences. By combining our extensive range of high-performance projectors with our cutting-edge integrated solutions, we are well-equipped to meet and exceed the evolving demands of the entertainment industry. Projectors are becoming smaller in size but able to output higher lumens, powered by various illumination technologies such as RGB pure laser that pushes the boundaries of color reproduction, brightness, resolution, image uniformity, installation versatility, and operational lifetime. This makes projection technology ideal for the creation of unparalleled shared experiences. We are also seeing greater integration with powerful software tools to simplify the deployment process for live events. Our Christie Mystique automated camera-based alignment software is a case in point. It enables users to quickly install, align, calibrate and maintain multi-projection systems. Additionally, projection technology is increasingly being integrated with AR and VR to create immersive environments. This trend is particularly significant in sectors such as education, training, entertainment, and retail, where it enhances the user experience by blending physical and digital worlds. At the same time, with growing environmental concerns, there is a push towards more energy-efficient and eco-friendly projector designs. Christie projectors are designed with sustainability in mind and the Christie Griffyn 4K50-RGB pure laser projector is a good example. Even though it has a high brightness output of 50,000 lumens, it’s also the most energy-efficient laser projector available today in its class, generating an incredible 15.9 lumens per watt. Comparable projectors in the same class only deliver an average of 10 lumens per watt. Christie will continue to embrace continuous innovation, prioritize customer-centricity, and adopt sustainable practices. We will also maintain our efforts in investing in R&D to advance technologies like RGB pure laser projection, and direct-view LED.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

    "Author Name": null,
    "Author URL": null,
    "Article Content": "Commvault, released new critical insights from its 2024 Cyber Recovery Readiness Report. This global survey of 1,000 security and IT professionals across 11 countries, reveals interesting behavior changes for organizations that have been breached versus those that have not. The Commvault survey, done in collaboration with GigaOm, shows that organizations that have endured cyber incidents in the past don't want to get burned again. Consequently, they often reassess and invest in cyber resilience and recovery strategies in very meaningful ways. According to the survey: Investments in cyber resilience increase: Organizations that have been breached spend nearly 30% more on cybersecurity measures than those that haven't. More attention is given to understanding data risk profiles: Breached organizations are nearly 2.5 times more likely to prioritize understanding their data risk profiles, which highlight data types and relative levels of risk. Cyber readiness testing is prioritized: Breached organizations conduct more testing to find gaps in their cyber preparedness plans. Twenty percent of organizations that haven't been breached do not test their recovery plan at all, that number drops to just 2% for organizations that have been breached. The impact of these added investments and focus on cyber resilience is significant. According to the survey, breached organizations that have invested in comprehensive cyber recovery plans recover 41% faster than their less-prepared counterparts. In terms of specific recovery times, breached organizations state that they are 32% more likely to recover within 48 hours compared to those that have not been breached – a much better outcome than the recovery times noted by other respondents, which could be three weeks or more. This reduced downtime can translate to significant savings, both in terms of direct financial losses and the preservation of customer trust and brand reputation. \"We've all heard the expression hindsight is 20/20, and that could not be more applicable when it comes to the findings of this survey,\" said  . \"Our survey shows that the most resilient organizations are those that continuously test and refine their recovery strategies, learning from each incident to strengthen their defenses. It's this proactive mindset, rather than reactive spending, that makes the difference.\" Much like health insurance, where the cost of coverage often far outweighs the potential expenses of medical emergencies, cyber recovery readiness serves a similar purpose. The report underscores that the costs of being breached – ranging from operational disruption to regulatory fines – far exceed the expenses of proactive cyber resilience measures. \"The findings should be a call to action for all organizations, not just those that have been breached,\" said  . \"Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and so too must the strategies to counter them. It's about adopting a holistic approach to cyber resilience that integrates people, processes, and technology, ensuring readiness at every level.\" In addition to these findings, Commvault and GigaOm were able to pinpoint five key capabilities, also called resiliency markers, that when deployed together, helped companies recover faster from cyberattacks and experience fewer breaches compared to companies that did not follow the same path. These five resiliency markers emerged after data analysis teams combed through the same survey results across a range of topics including: how often companies were breached, what resilience technologies were (or were not) deployed, and how rapidly businesses were able to recover data and resume normal operations.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

    "Article Content": "Pravilo desne strane je fundamentalno načelo regulisanja saobraćaja, odnono određivanja prvenstva prolaza, u slučajevima kada se ukrštaju putevi iste važnosti. Prva lekcija u auto-školama jeste upravo ta da, ukoliko ne postoji  znak, ili druga oznaka, propustite vozilo koja vam nailazi sa desne strane, u slučaju da nailazite na put iste važnosti. Postoji, međutim, i druga signalizacija koja ima gotovo istu snagu, a da su je vozači potpuno izgubli iz vida. Međutim, u slučaju saonraćajne nesreće možete biti krivi i platiti štetu, a da pojma nemate da ste izazvali udes nepoštujući zakon.  se, naime, deli na vertikalnu signalizaciju i horizontalnu signalizaciju. Bilo da se radi o vertikalnoj ili horizontalnoj saobračajnoj signalizaciji, njena namena je regulisanje ili usmeravanje saobraćaja, obeležavanje vozila ili obezbeđivanje mesta izvođenja radova na kolovozu. Horizontalna signalizacija Horizontalna signalizacija predstavlja skup posebno oblikovanih geometrijskih elemenata linija, figura, polja i natpisa koji formiraju oznake na saobraćajnim površinama. Horizontalna signalizacija postoji i na drugim površinama: parkinzima, trotoarima, komunikacijama unutar garaža, aerodromskim pistama itd. Osnovna podela horizontalne signalizacije potiče od namene oznaka. Ova podela uslovljena je položajem oznaka u odnosu na simetralu kolovoza puta ili ulice: uzdužne oznake(razdelne linije, ivične linije, linije vodilje i sl), poprečne oznake, linije zaustavljanja (ova oznaka se često naziva i \"stop\" linija), pešački prelazi, prelazi biciklističkih staza, kosnici,graničnici, itd. i ostale oznake, strelice, natpisi, polja i linije za usmeravanje, oznake za parkiranje itd. Damir Okanović, direktor Komiteta za bezbednost saobraćaja, navodi da horizontalna signalizacija ima obavezujući karakter. \"Po važećim propisima ako na prilazu raskrsnici nisu postavljeni STOP ili obrnuti trougao, a na kolovozu postoji linija zaustavljanja (zaustavna linija) vozači se obaveštavaju o obavezi zaustavljanja odnosno propuštanja vozila na putu na koji nailaze, samom zaustavnom linijom. Pošto vozač može da ne vidi zaustavnu liniju usled npr. snega na kolovozu ili vozila koje se kreće ispred njegovog, nije dobro da na raskrsnici bude samo zaustavna linija bez znaka STOP ili bez obrnutog trougla. Zbog toga učesnici u saobraćaju kada primete da postoji zaustavna linija a nema znaka STOP ili obrnutog trougla, treba da obaveste upravljača puta kako bi postavili saobraćajni znak\", objašnjava Okanović. Ako blagovremeno uočite zaustavnu liniju na kolovozu, a ne propustite vozila na putu na koji ste naišli, možete prekršajno ali i krivično odgovarati. Zbog toga obratite pažnju i na horizontalnu signalizaciju kada nailazite na raskrnicu, jer može skupo da vas košta.

    "Article Content": "Žena koja je nedavno kupila  , suočila se sa ozbiljnim problemom, kada je uvidela da je kiloemtraža vraćena za \"tričavih\" 100.000 kilometara! \"Poštovani, vezano za konstantno aktuelne priče o lažnim kilometražama i ja sam nasela na jednu, ali možda ima izlaza, zato vam se i obraćam. Auto ima kilometražu na meraču 176.000 kilometara, tako sam ga kupila i registrovala. Sat vremena kasnije otvaram ladicu auta i nalazim urednu servisnu knjižicu sa više datuma servisa i zadnji je iz maja rađen na 274.000 kilometara. \"Da nisam saznala, bilo bi mi lakše. Naravno, zvala sam ih, oni, naravno, nisu ništa znali ni garantovali... Registrovana je firma preko koje sam kupila. Da li imam neke zakonske osnove da ih gonim?\", napisala je ona. Kako da prepoznate vraćenu kilometražu? Pre svega, treba da gledate stanje vozila, jer auto koji je prešao više od 1oo.ooo km ne može imati kao nov upravljač. 3 stvari posebno otkrivaju da je auto prešao mnogo čak i kada vas zavaraju kilometražom. A te tri stvari su - istrošenost upravljača, nožnih komandi i ručice menjača. Sve to govori da je automobil prešao mnogo. Ipak, danas je sve to moguće brzo i jeftino srediti, što važi i za sedišta – ukoliko su propala, lako se slepe posebnom penom ili se ubacuju novi sunđeri ili opruge, a zatim se presvuku i deluju kao nova. Presvlače se i vrata, „nebo“ i ostali tapacirani delovi. Ofucani sigurnosni pojasi se takođe lako i jeftino menjaju. Zbog toga ima razloga za sumnju i ukoliko neki delovi enterijera deluju suviše očuvano. Ponekad se čak ubacuju sedišta iz havarisanih ali novijih i očuvanijih vozila. Zato se uvek dobro posavetujte sa svojim automehaničarem, ali u četiri oka. Nijedan prodavac ne voli da ga razotkriju! Nedavno  koje je sprovela automobilska kompanija carVertical u 14 evropskih zemalja otkrilo je da automobili uvezeni u Srbiju imaju veću verovatnoću da im je vraćena kilometraža u poređenju s vozilima kupljenim u zemlji.

Additionally, we've improved our SellerApp, which now enables businesses to retarget customers via SMS, Email, and WhatsApp. The emphasis is on simplicity, speed, and security, with our solutions being fully compliant with the Security Operations Centre (SOC) Framework. These changes are driven by a deep understanding of how consumers interact with technology today, making our dashboard more intuitive and user-friendly, allowing businesses to unlock hidden potentials with ease.

Additionally, our support team is always ready to assist with any queries, ensuring that even those with minimal technical expertise can leverage our solutions effectively.

    "Article Content": "Poplave prete Evropi, u Rumuniji je sve pod vodom, drama je u Austriji, . Nije tajna da nam polovnjaci najviše dolaze iz Evrope, a budući da Srbi vole da pazare automobile sa Zapada, bitno je proveriti da li su preživeli poplavu ili su sve vreme bili na suvom! Ovo su neki znakovi da je automobil bio poplavljen: Obratite pažnju na koroziju - Automobili u godinama, koji su prešli više stotina hiljada kilometara, sa spoljne strane mogu imati koroziju, ali ne i unutra! Ono što morate da znate jeste, da korozija unutar kabine se ne pojavljuje ni nakon 30 godina vožnje.. Naravno ako automobil nije bio potopljen. Međutim, ukoliko je bio potopljen, koroziju je moguće primetiti u donjim tačkama kabine. U tom slučaju najbolje je detaljno pogledati gepek i prostor oko rezervnog točka. Obavezno podignite rubove tepiha i vidite šta je ispod njih. Za kraj obavezno pogledajte šine sedišta i prostor ispod sedišta (koristite ogledalo i baterijsku lamu ako je nepristupačno). Kako su pomenute šine presvučene najtanjim slojem zaštite, njihova korozija bi mogla da ukaže na to da je automobil bio potopljen. Problem sa elektronikom - Ako majstor ne može da popravi grešku u elektronici, eto vama mogućnosti da je automobil bio poplavljen! Kako instalacije prve stradaju od strane korozije, obavezno je proveriti da li svi pokazivači i sva svetla rade, kako spolja tako i iznutra, potom da li ventilacija i klima rade, zajedno sa upaljačem. Tokom testiranja automobila pre kupovine, obavezno pri paljenju oslušnite da li automobil, tj. njegova elektronika proizvodi neočekivane zvukove, ili neočekivan smrad paljevine, koji može da ukaže na neispravnost elektronike. Promena tepiha, neba i presvlaka - Ukoliko se radi o skupom automobilu, izvlačenje vlage i korišćenje hemikalija nije opcija, već će majstori preko grane posegnuti za promenom tepiha, neba i presvlaka. U slučaju da je automobil stariji od 6-7 godina, lako se može ustanoviti da se radi o novim već pomenutim elementima. Amortizacija oko prostora stopala, i na vozačevom ili suvozačevom mestu, treba treba detaljno da se pregleda, jer ako je automobil vožen više od 6-7 godina, znakovi amortizacije i rabljena moraju da budu prisutni (izlizanost tepiha na pojedinim mestima recimo). Ako su presvlake nove, pa ručno šivene, to može biti \"red flag\" za automobil koji je realno stariji. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ).

Autora snimka koji se našao u čudnoj situaciji zanimalo je ko ima prednost u ovom slučaju, piše u opisu snimka koji je objavila Fejsbuk stranica Ispod snimka je preko 200 komentara, a ljudi su u šoku i kažu kako je pravo čudo da nema više nesreća kada vozači ne znaju ni osnove saobraćajnih pravila i propisa. Situacija za koju snimatelj nije siguran ko ima prednost je ta da su oba vozila na glavnoj ulici. Snimatelju ta glavna ulica ide desno, a on želi da nastavi pravo na ulicu koja je sporedna. S desne strane mu dolazi automobil koji skreće desno, takođe u tu sporednu ulicu. - Ne mogu da verujem da neko ovo ne zna! Vratite vozačke u policiju, manje ljudi će stradati - piše neko u komentaru, dok se ljudi svađaju i oko pravila koje se gleda u odnosu na ovu situaciju. - Desni auto ima prednost jer radi manji luk - napisao je neko, dok drugi odgovara da snimatelj može slobodno pravo jer mu je iznad znaka - zelena krošnja.

    "Article Content": "Kad kupujete polovni automobil, valja otvoriti četvore oči i slušati savete iskusnih. Najbolje je da ne kupujete \"bolesnike\" odnosno   koji su pregaženi u gradskoj vožnji, kreni-stani, te koji su prešli stotine hiljada kilometara. Ipak, ako niste automehaničar i nemate jednog u familiji, valja znati kako proveriti da li je vaš potencijalni automobil zapravo problematičan iako je naoko lep, našminkan i sa manjom kilometražom. A tu su bitne 3 stvari na polovnom automobilu koje otkrivaju da je porešao mnogo. U suštini, automobil uvek treba razgledati po danu! Bitno je pogledati šasiju, (tzv. VIN), gde treba obratiti pažnju na šire područje oko broja – možda je čitav komad lima sa brojem isečen i zavaren novi ili je na neki drugi način falsifikovan. Proveru možete da obavite u policiji (ima slučajeva da su vozila oduzimana i po godinu ili dve dana nakon što su prošla proveru u policiji) ili u Centru za motorna vozila (CMZ) Auto–moto saveza Srbije. Postoji i stara, ali nepouzdana provera magnetom – ako se magnet ne  lepi za neku površinu, možete posumnjati da se ispod laka nalazi git. U znak da je vozilo pretrpelo težak udes spadaju nejednaki zazori između  . Naročito pažnju obratite na  . Ipak 3 stvari posebno otkrivaju da je auto prešao mnogo čak i kada vas zavaraju kilometražom. A te tri stvari su - istrošenost upravljača, nožnih komandi i ručice menjača. Sve to govori da je automobil prešao mnogo. Ipak, danas je sve to moguće brzo i jeftino srediti, što važi i za sedišta – ukoliko su propala, lako se slepe posebnom penom ili se ubacuju novi sunđeri ili opruge, a zatim se presvuku i deluju kao nova. Presvlače se i vrata, „nebo“ i ostali tapacirani delovi. Ofucani sigurnosni pojasi se takođe lako i jeftino menjaju. Zbog toga ima razloga za sumnju i ukoliko neki delovi enterijera deluju suviše očuvano. Ponekad se čak ubacuju sedišta iz havarisanih ali novijih i očuvanijih vozila. Zato se uvek dobro posavetujte sa svojim automehaničarem, ali u četiri oka. Nijedan prodavac ne voli da ga razotkriju!

Kriptovalute su prešle sa digitalnih kurioziteta na sredstva koja se koriste za različite transakcije, uključujući kupovinu softvera i, kontroverzno, ilegalne aktivnosti.   Međutim, kritičari tvrde da oni olakšavaju kriminalne aktivnosti i doprinose nestabilnosti i nejednakosti tržišta. Decentralizovana priroda kriptovaluta, koje funkcionišu na blokčejn tehnologiji, dozvoljava transakcije bez centralnog autoriteta.  Njegova tržišna kapitalizacija odavno premašila 1 milijardu dolara. Druge kriptovalute poput Ethereuma, pa čak i šaljive valute kao što je Dogecoin, takođe su postale popularne. Kao odgovor na bum kriptovaluta, mnoge vlade istražuju uvođenje digitalnih valuta centralne banke (CBDC - Central Bank Digital Currency).   CBDC nude prednosti kriptovaluta brzinu i digitalnu efikasnost, bez povezanih rizika neregulisanih sredstava. Međutim, oni dolaze sa sopstvenim izazovima, uključujući zabrinutost oko centralizacije moći i podataka u jednoj instituciji.  Pored toga, kriptovalute su postale alat za sajber kriminalce, teroriste i odmetničke države da izbegnu sankcije i olakšaju nezakonite aktivnosti.  Neregulisana priroda kriptovaluta dovela je do zabrinutosti zbog prevare, utaje poreza i finansijske stabilnosti.  Uprkos svom potencijalu, kriptovalute kao što je Bitkoin se i dalje prvenstveno koriste za špekulacije, a mnogi investitori se nadaju dugoročnim dobitima zasnovanim na budućim primenama blokčejn tehnologije.

    "Article Content": "Američki Consumer Reports je napravio veliko istraživanje pouzdanosti . Za ovu listu, ispitali su više od 150.000 vozila godišta od 2014. do 2109. u vlasništvu svojih članova, upoređujući broj problema koje je svaki auto imao s prosekom za sva vozila. Ovim procesom su dobijeni rezultati pouzdanosti za svaku marku. Lexus i Toyota bili su najpouzdanije marke polovnih automobila s velikom razlikom u odnosu na sve ostale, potvrđujući svoju reputaciju među kupcima, piše Auto Klub. Stiven Elek, voditelj programa Consumer Reportsa za analitiku podataka o automobilima, rekao je da su ove dve marke poznate po \"konzervativnom postupnom poboljšavanju cijele linije proizvoda, umjesto uvođenja mnogih potpuno novih sustava\". Ovo je lista najboljih marki rabljenih automobila: Dok ove lestvice daju širok pogled na pouzdanost marke, stručnjaci ipak savetuju da se prilikom kupovine istraži svaki model pojedinačno. Osim toga, treba uzeti u obzir i cienu i vrstu popravki. Jedno vozilo može imati više problema s jeftinim popravkama, dok bi drugo moglo biti sklono manjem broju skupih problema.

    "Article Content": " Dok pišem ovaj tekst u mislima mi prolaze svi oni trenuci u kojima smo razgovarali, pa i sarađivali. Njegov autorski opus zaista je ogroman i o tome sam više puta pisao. U ovom tekstu pokušaću da vas podsetim na segment njegovog stvaralaštva koji je ovdašnjoj publici svakako manje poznat, ali je zaista izuzetan, a i njemu samom bio je jako važan. Ako govorimo o domaćoj instrumentalnoj muzici koju su stvarali rok muzičari, svakako stoji da ona nije lako pronalazila put do slušalaca, a ako i jeste, to su uglavnom bili gitarski instrumentali. Setimo se recimo kompozicija kao što su \"Dinamit\" Josipa Bočeka, \"Ulazak u harem\" R.M. Točka ili \"Jednoj ženi\" Zlatka Manojlovića. Takođe, tu su i mnoge sjajne obrade iz ovdašnjeg etno nasleđa, poput \"Aber dojde Donke\" grupe Leb i Sol, \"Zajdi, zajdi\" od Smaka, ili izvanredne Točkove solo partije koju je doneo u kompoziciji \"Ukor\". Kasnije su neki od ovih gitarista objavili i svoje instrumentalne albume, a među prvima su to uradili R.M. Točak (1977.), a takođe i Zlatko Manojlović (1980.). O gotovo svim gore navedenim kompozicijama pisao sam tekstove, ali svakako ne treba smetnuti s uma da postoji i izuzetan instrumentalni, autorski opus, koji su u onim zlatnim danima rok muzike ostavili iza sebe neki od naših najpoznatijih klavijaturista. Jedan od prvih solo albuma objavio je Tihomir Pop Asanović (\"Majko zemljo\" 1974.), ali s obzirom da je taj LP pretežno vokalni (izuzev kompozicija \"Berlin I\" i \"Berlin II\"),  Kornelije Kovač svakako spada u red onih pionira koji su se odvažili da krenu u vode instrumentalne muzike Zašto kažem odvažio? Možda je najbolje objašnjenje za to dao sam Kornelije u jednom intervjuu koji sam vodio s njim:  (iz knjige \"Gramofonske priče\", autora Gorana Živanovića) Da je ovo tačno, svedoči i činjenica da je mnogo više onih koji su, nakon prestanka rada Korni grupe, upoznati sa Kornelijevim kompozitorskim radom za naše tada veoma popularne pevače kao što su to recimo Zdravko Čolić, Bisera Veletanlić, Zlatko Pejaković itd, nego sa njegovim solo ostvarenjima. U tekstu koji sledi podsetiću vas na nekoliko kompozicije iz tog opusa. Ovo je prva ploča koju je Kornelije Kovač objavio pod svojim imenom nakon razlaza Korni grupe. Sećam se da sam komoziciju \"Okean\" prvi put čuo kada sam bio osmi razred. Bio sam naprosto očaran. Toliko mi se svideo taj instrumental da sam odmah shvatio kako tu ploču moram imati što pre. Kornelije je ovde po ko zna koji put pokazao koliki je majstor svog zanata. Iako se kompozicija \"Okean\" našla na B strani ovog singla, tih godina mnogo češće je emitovana na talasima radio stanica, mada ni A strana na kojoj je \"Severni vetar\", nije ništa lošija i zvuči stvarno svetski. Ovo je za mene jedan od onih čarobnih singlova iz sedamdesetih godina, ploča koja pokazuje kakvi talenti su stasavali u jednoj relativno maloj zemlji kao što je to Jugoslavija. Nakon ovog fantastičnog singla, mnogi su očekivali (među njima i ja) sledeći Kornelijev potez. U stvari čekao se album. Do realizacije takve ideje nikada nije došlo, a razlozi za to nisu bili do kraja jasni. Tada se govorkalo da je čitav plan propao jer je Dado bio neodlučan, čas je hteo, čas nije, da se priključi grupi. Međutim, Dadovo mišljenje sasvim je drugačije, što mi je i izneo u jednom razgovoru: (misli na gradove u kojima su živeli muzičari koji su trebali da sviraju u K2, op. autora) Interesantno je da će gotovo svi članovi ove zamišljene super grupe svirati na Kornelijevom prvom solo albumu. Dakle, tu su bili gitarista Josip Boček, basista Čarli Novak, klavijaturisti Sloba Marković i Sanja Ilić, bubnjari Lazar Tošić i Ratko Divjak, dok su pevačke deonice podelili Zvezdana Sterle, Nada Žgur i Oto Pestner.  Taj LP je u suštini bio dobar, na njemu je bilo dosta vokalnih kompozicija, ali ruku na srce, čini se da nije bilo neke koja bi mogla da povuče ceo album. U jednom razgovoru upitao sam ga zašto je doneo takvu odluku, kada je ovde već stekao ime vredno svakog poštovanja, njegov odgovor bio je ovakav:  (iz knjige \"Gramofonske priče, autora Gorana Živanovića) LP je kao i prethodni objavila izdavačka kuća PGP RTB i to je stvarno bila odlično urađena ploča. Na ploči se nalazi i par sjajnih instrumentala poput \"Scottish Bird\", a tu je i instrumentalna verzija poznate pesme Korni grupe, \"Put za istok\". Tih godina slušao sam ga jako puno, jednostavno nisam mogao da prestanem. Iako je Kornelije i dalje objavljivao svoja solo ostvarenja, ja ću u ovoj priči upravo ovde stati. Sa ploče\"Sampled Moon\"  gotovo da sam mogao odabrati bilo koju kompoziciju za ovaj prikaz, ipak, odlučio sam se za \"Still Chicken\" i \"Anna F\". Za prvu, mnogi koji su je čuli uopšte i ne znaju da je iz opusa Kornelija Kovača, dok je druga posvećena Ani Frank i jedina je kompozicija na albumu u kojoj je korišćen glas, ali u funkciji instrumenta. Tu deonicu otpevala je Kornelijeva ćerka Aleksandra koja je tada imala samo četrnaest godina. Međutim, isto tako, mogao sam se odlučiti i za nestvarnu \"Get It Right Boy\", ili na primer \"Cola-Kid\", ili za više nego sjajnu \"Dancing On The White Beach\". Interesantno je da je bilo zlobnika koji su tvrdili da je Kornelije inspiraciju za ovu poslednju pronašao u kompoziciji \"Get Out of Your Lazy Bed\", koju je par godina ranije objavila britanska grupa Matt Bianco. Malo šta je delovalo tako opuštajuće i umirujuće kao ova ploča. Bar je kod mene bilo tako. Nažalost, ako na YOU TUBE danas pogledate broj pregleda ovih kompozicija, razočaraćete se. Ta brojka jedva da dostiže nekoliko hiljada (izuzev kompozicije \"Okean\" koja ima nešto više\"), Srećom ima i onih, među koje ubrajam i sebe, kojima ti pregledi apsolutno ništa ne znače i na to se uopšte i ne obaziru. I da: Kornelije je pisao i sjajnu filmsku muziku, zatim špice za mnoge popularne televizijske i radio emisije, i tu takođe ima sjajnih instrumentala, ali o svemu tome možda u nekoj od naših narednih priča. Njegova muzika zauvek će obasjavati ove prostore. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ). Telegraf.rs zadržava sva prava nad sadržajem.

    "Article Content": "Predsednica Pokrajinske vlade   otvorila je večeras u Novom Sadu 17. \"Tamburica fest 2024\", poručivši da je ova manifestacija među najverodostojnijim čuvarima tradicije i kulturnog nasleđa Novog Sada, Vojvodine i Srbije. \"Svojim konceptom i programom, onim što nudi takmičarima i brojnim gostima, i zahvaljujući prepoznatljivosti širom sveta, 'Tamburica fest' je od samog nastanka mnogo više od uobičajenog mesta okupljanja ljubitelja ovog muzičkog instrumenta i njegovog zvuka. I večeras, kao i na svim prethodnim svetkovinama kvalitetne muzike i lepe pesme, svedoci smo da umetnost i kultura predstavljaju jedan od najboljih načina zbližavanja i boljeg upoznavanja raznih naroda\", poručila je Gojković. Ona je istakla da je tamburica, jedan od najstarijih žičanih instrumenata, među najupečatljivijim delovima \"naše muzičke tradicije i kulturnog identiteta\". Gojković je podsetila na to da su očuvanje i negovanje kulturnog nasleđa, kao i njegovo prenošenje generacijama koje dolaze, među ključnim faktorima razvoja svakog društva. \"Briga o zaštiti naše kulturne baštine treba da bude važan zadatak svima nama koji se njome na bilo koji način bavimo. To uključuje i podršku koju Pokrajinska vlada pruža ustanovama, organizacijama i pojedincima koji vredno rade na očuvanju naše muzičke tradicije, među kojima je nesumnjivo i naš ‘Tamburica fest'\", navela je Gojković. Ona je dodala da o značaju tamburice govori i to što je tamburaška praksa 2021. godine upisana u Nacionalni registar nematerijalnog kulturnog nasleđa. Dodala je da su manifestacije poput ove važne, jer spajaju nasleđe sa savremenim stvaralaštvom, čineći tako tradiciju i običaje i \"živim\" i vidljivim, dajući im aktivnu ulogu u nastanku novih umetničkih dela. Na festivalu svake godine nastupaju orkestri iz zemlje i inostranstva u takmičarskom delu programa za najbolji orkestar Svetskog tamburica festa, a vokalni solisti iz celog sveta učestvuju u izboru za najbolju autorsku pesmu Tamburica festa. U okviru ove manifestacije nastala je i Svetska tamburaška asocijacija, udruženje svih tamburaša sveta sa sedištem u Novom Sadu, navodi se u saopštenju Pokrajinske vlade.

Ipak, u Srbiji je i dalje relativno nepoznata i retko dostupna u prodavnicama. Za sve one koji žele da probaju nešto drugačije i egzotično, crna sapota je svakako voće koje vredi potražiti.

    "Article Content": "Gost nove epizode video serijala \"Tanjug Reflektor\" bio je glumac Peđa Marjanović koji je govorio o trećoj sezoni serije \"Močvara\" i rekao da će publiku i treću sezonu serije povezati specifičan format. Marjanović je istakao da mu je bilo čudno da kroči u svet \"Močvare\" jer je, do tada, seriju posmatrao samo iz ugla gledaoca. \"Bilo je čudno kročiti u astmosferu, misterioznost i tajanstvenost, ali bilo mi je zanimljivo da gledam kako se to stvara. Kako Oleg to režira i kako vodi pažljivo glumce kroz to. I zapitao bih se da li ja sad snimam i prisustvujem ovde ili ne. Drugačije je, bez obzira što je čovek glumac, drugačije je kad učestvuješ i kad stvaraš, a drugačije je kada to posmatraš\", objasnio je on. Prema njegovim rečima, čast i privilegija je sarađivati sa rediteljem Olegom Novkovićem i igrati u komadima čije dramske tekstove piše Milena Marković. \"Učiš je na fakultetu i čitaš njene drame i sad odjednom razgovaraš sa njom i igraš u seriji koju je ona pisala. To je kao prisustvovati tom činu stvaranja i gledati njih kako rade. To je meni bilo najzanimljivije\", objasnio je Marjanović. Marjanović tumači ulogu mladog inspektora Miloša koji je \"štreberski nastrojen prema poslu i želi da se dokaže\". Pored toga, Marijanović je istakao da je ta uloga bila glumački zahtevna kada je scenario, koji se odnosi na prisustvo mrtvim telima, u pitanju. \"Nažalost sam imao iskustvo prisustva jednoj obdukciji iz ličnih razloga. Priključio sam se obdukciji nekog tela na pravnom fakultetu jer je moj cimer studirao prava.. Obdukciji je prisustvovao i neki profesor na akademiji i rekao nam je kako bi bilo super iskustvo da mi kao glumci odemo da pogledamo\", rekao je on. Prema njegovim rečima prisustvo obdukciji je posebno iskustvo iako se čovek u početku plaši da priđe čoveku koji nije živ. \"To zapravo nije čovek, ima obrise ljudskog, vidi se i misao na njemu i to je nešto što je bila osoba i to je nešto strašno. Mi nemamo iskustvo da vidimo ljude koji su mrtvi. Mi samo razgovaramo i komuniciramo sa živim ljudima i kad naiđeš na nešto što znaš da je bilo živo, a sad više nije, jako ti je to čudno\", rekao je Marjanović.

Karte su za 13.septembar bile rasprodate, a sledeći datumi kada će se \"Lu\" naći na daskama koje život znače, jesu 14. i 15. septembar, kao i 20. 21. i 22. septembar. - Ovo sam ja... Ovaj teatar je moj konačni odgovor. Možda mi je dugo trebalo da svom ludilu, onom kreativnom pronađem pravi put i pravo odelo i od danas i nakon ove premijere, siguran sam da konačno imam pečat na potvrdu da sam napravio najbolju stvar u svojoj dosadašnjoj karijeri - rekao je za Telegraf Željko Mitrović, posle velikih ovacija, i dodao: - Ali predstava Lu je samo početak, a granica je nebo... Svetske premijere u svetskom, a srpskom teatru tek slede. \"LU\" je predstava koja donosi priču o Princu Tame, Luciferu, iz potpuno drugačijeg ugla. Lucifer je po kazni poslat na Zemlju, među ljude. Ali postoje likovi koji mogu da iznenade i samog Lucifera. Kad pokuša da kupi dušu opštinskog funkcionera Srbe i usput se zaljubi u njegovu sestru Veru, Lucifer ne može da veruje šta ga je snašlo. Shvata šta je ljubav – da zbog nje žene plaču, a muškarci piju i lažu da ne plaču. I Lu je upao u tu klopku i mora da se izbori sam sa sobom, jer ako pokaže slabost – gubi sve što je Princu Tame važno. Sjajna glumačka postava predvođena je Žarkom Dimoskim, Markom Markovićem, Stojanom Đorđevićem, Miljanom Prljetom i Vesnom Paštrović.

    "Article Content": "Fenomenalni britanski bend Singing loins, koji svira kako sami kažu \"sirovi folk sa Delte Midveja\", nastupio je sinoć u prepunom klubu Doma kulture. Ovo je njihov četvrti nastup u Pirotu, a u Srbiji su nastupali pre Pirota u Beogradu i Novom Sadu. U Pirot međutim dolaze četvrti put, zadnji put su bili pre više od decenije, a pevač benda Artur Alan kaže za Telegraf.rs da u Srbiju uvek rado dolaze i to sa posebnim emocijama. -Mi smo četvrti put u Pirotu. Zadnji put je bilo davno pre možda 15 godina, tada je sa nama bio i bivši frontmen benda i svojevrsno zaštitno lice benda Kris Broderik, koji je nažalost preminuo pre par godina. Sada ćemo dosta njegovih pesama svirati, ali u novom ruhu, imamo veći saund, imamo violinu, mandolinu u bendu, osim standardnog bubnja i dve gitare-kaže Alan, uz konstataciju da njega i njegove klupske drugare posebno oduševljava srpska hrana. -Hrana je ovde fenomenalna, svašta smo probali, mnogo vrsta mesa, sve je izvrsno, jedan od kolega je oduševljen pirotskim sirom, kačkavaljem, koga je probao ovde-priča Alan i dodaje da će bend na veliku evropsku turneju zapravo krenuti naredne godine, a ovo je svega nekoliko koncerata po Engleskoj, i odmah zatim Srbiji, kako bi se publici predstavio novi album. Alan kaže da jedna od stvari koji ih je fascinirala još kada su prvi put došli u Srbiju, bila činjenica da Srbi prosto obožavaju kultnu engelsku seriju Mućke. -Jedan od mlađih članova nije mogao da veruje kada je u Beogradu iz stana u kome smo bili, pogledavši kroz prozor, video ogroman grafit \"Only fools and horses\". Tada sam mu, s obzirom da sam ranije bio sa starom postavkom, objasnio da ovde svi obožavaju Rodnija, Del Boja i ostale aktere Mućki, što je potpuno fascinantno-kaže Alan. Koncert u Pirotu oduševio je publiku u holu Doma kulture koja je, na iznenađenje ovog kultnog benda, horski pevala brojne hitove \"Kraljeva Delte Midveja\", kako ih još nazivaju u Engleskoj. (A.Ć.)

    "Article Content": "U petak 13. septembra svečano je otvoren 20. festival evropskog dugometražnog dokumentarnog filma “7 veličanstvenih” u Mts dvorani. Prisutnima su se na otvaranju obratili direktor festivala Zoran Popović, festivalski selektor Tue Stin Miler, i autor filma otvaranja „Pijanoforte“ Jakub Pjontek. Zoran Popović, direktor festivala „7 veličanstvenih“, na otvaranju je rekao: „Pre dvadeset godina postojao je samo san o velikom sjajnom bioskopu, o velikom platnu, o fantastičnim filmovima i veličanstvenoj publici. Nakon 20 godina, svi smo zajedno u tom snu, koji je uspeo da se ostvari. Da li zato što smo uložili svu našu snagu, trud i energiju da otvorimo široko vrata filmovima koji su i u Evropi tek dolazili i najavljivali jedno novo poglavlje u istoriji filma; da li zato što smo imali podršku zaista sjajnih, veličanstvenih evropskih dokumentarista i jednog izuzetnog Danca koji je gotovo postao Beograđanin, Tue Stin Milera; da li zato što je sve to spojila jedna veličanstvena, evropska publika, koja voli dokumentarni film, bioskop, i uživa u onome što je magija filma. Sve to zajedno, tokom dvadeset godina, stvaralo je legendu o festivalu, koju širom Evrope pronose eminentni evropski dokumentaristi, pričajući o nečemu što gotovo da nikada u svojoj karijeri nisu sreli, a događa se u Beogradu“. Tue Stin Miler, selektor festivala, ispričao je priču o imaginarnom susretu Hansa Kristijana Andersena i Nikole Tesle, i njihovom razgovoru o budućnosti pokretnih slika. „Oni nisu više ovde, ali pre neki dan sedeli su na jednom oblaku iznad Beograda. Andersen je rekao Tesli kako je ipak postojala mogućnost da se slike pokrenu. U Beogradu ima jedna tačka i jedno mesto gde se već 20 godina prikazuju slike koje se pokreću. S tvojim genijalnim umom i mojim pripovedanjem, te dve stvari su se spojile u nešto što ide zajedno, nešto veličanstveno. Andersen je bio u pravu. Živeo festival Sedam veličanstvenih!“ Jakub Pjontek, reditelj filma otvaranja „Pijanoforte“, prisutnima se obratio rečima: „Veoma sam privilegovan što sam ovde. Mlađi sam od 40 godina, pa mi 20 godina festivala izgleda kao divan san. Hvala vam na gostoprimstvu i nadam se da ćete uživati u filmu“. Po završetku ceremonije otvaranja, premijerno u Srbiji je prikazan film “Pijanoforte” koji nas vodi na najčuvenije svetsko takmičenje mladih pijanista. Kao svojevrsna pijanistička Olimpijada, svake pete godine u Varšavi se okupljaju vrhunski mladi umetnici i započinju bespoštednu borbu sa samima sobom da bi postigli gotovo nemoguće i savladali sve teže i teže zadatke i eventualno pobedili. Sjajni poljski autor Jakub Pjontek napravio je uzbudljiv i intrigantan film koji nas vodi iza kulisa ovog takmičenja, a najveće zadovoljstvo u filmu je pijanistički i filmski briljantno predstavljena muzika koja je opčinila gledaoce brojnih festivala širom sveta od Sandensa do Tel Aviva. Nakon projekcije održan je razgovor sa autorom filma. Program festivala nastavlja se u subotu, 14. septembra u 20 časova, filmom “Balomanija” danske rediteljke Sisel Morel Dargis. Do kraja festivala publika će moći da pogleda i ostvarenja “Tvoj život bez mene” mađarske rediteljke Ane Rubi (15. septembar, 18h), “Šaptač risovima” finskog reditelja Juhe Suonpe (15. septembar, 20h), „Gospodin Bo“ italijanske rediteljke Klaudije Tozi (16. septembar, 20h), „Ja sam reka, reka je ja“ holandskog reditelja Petra Loma (17. septembar, 20h), „Nenet“ Nikole Filibera (18. septembar, 20h, specijalna projekcija) i „Bilo jednom u jednoj šumi“ finske rediteljke Virpi Sutari (19. septembar, 20h), koji će zatvoriti festival. Festival su pomogli Ministarstvo kulture Republike Srbije, Ambasade Finske i Danske u Srbiji uz druge sponzore i medijske pokrovitelje.

Enterijer Gocine dvospratna kuće opremljen je stilskim nameštajem i suvenirima, a kako je pevačica istakla, sve mora da joj bude pod konac. -Kod mene je red rad i disciplina i naravno red smeha - navela je pevačica i otkrila da je njena kuća zapravo njena oaza mira, a sve je dekorisala i opremila sama. Prostrani hodnik vodi do svih prostorija, a jedna od omiljenih prostorija joj je kuhinja jer ne može da zamisli dan bez jutarnje kafe. - Najviše volim ujutru da prvu kafu popijem potpuno sama, u tišini, ali napolju, u dvorištu. U stanju sam čak da sa skafanderom i kapom na glavi, čizmama izađem kada je hladno - priznala je Goca. I ne samo to, Goca je prava domaćica koja se ne libi da zasuče rukave i svojim najmilija pripremi specijalitete. - Spremam sve što moji vole, ali je sve to malo komplikovano jer moja ćerka ne jede meso, niti mast. Unuka ne jede sir, ni mleveno meso i onda kad dođe Božić kad se svi okupimo, ja pečem ćurku - priznala je pevačica. Osim u kuhinji, Goca većinu vremena provodi u trpezariji koju je opremila sa mnogo ljubavi. Elementi od punog drveta, svuda su zlatni detalji, uramljene skupocene slike na zidovima, vitrine sa posuđem i suvenirima koje je godinama donosila iz inostranstva. Cvetni aranžmani su neizostavni detalj svake prostorije, a malo ko zna da ih pevačica sama uzgaja u svojoj bašti. Pevačica poseduje i nekoliko spavaćih soba i kupatila na drugom spratu svoje raskošne kuće, te ne brine kada joj dođu gosti i članovi porodice jer ima dovoljno mesta da se svako od njih oseća komforno.

    "Article Content": "Pevačica   odlučila je da osnuje porodicu sa svojim partnerom, košarkašem  . Teodora godinu dana uživa u ljubavi sa svojim izabranikom Maticom, a navodi se da su odlučili da svoju vezu podignu na viši nivo. Iako se pevačica trudi da privatan život sačuva daleko od očiju javnosti, izvor blizak poznatom paru priča da oni već neko vreme rade na prinovi. - Teodora i Matic su se stvarno pronašli, oni su jednostavno srodne duše, funkcionišu kao jedno. Zaista su skladan par, oko svega se dogovaraju i svađe kod njih su nepoznanica. Ona nikada nije bila ovako srećna i zaljubljena, procvetala je otkad je sa njim, puna je nekog novog elena. Odavno su započeli zajednički život, te sada priželjkuju bebu i već neko vreme rade na tome. Oboje su porodični tipovi i žele veliku porodicu. Teodora je oduvek maštala da postane mlada mama i sada je shvatila da je Matic taj kome želi da podari dete i da provede ostatak života sa njim - otkrio je izvor blizak paru, koji je insistirao na anonimnosti i dodao da je dolaskom Teodorine bratanice na svet proradio i njen majčinski instinkt: - Teodorin brat Sava i snajka Adrijana nedavno su postali roditelji, što je u Teodori na neki način probudilo želju da i ona i Matic osnuju porodicu. Često ih posećuje jer voli da provodi vreme sa bebom, kad god ima slobodnog vremena. Razmišlja o tome kakva će ona majka biti, da li će se snaći, ima strah, ali isto tako i veliku želju za potomstvom. Da je među pevačicom i slovenačkim košarkašem sve idilično, svedoči činjenica da su Teodorini roditelji upoznali budućeg zeta, kao i njegovi nju, te da su im obe porodice dale blagoslov. - Teodorin otac, mama Goca i brat Sava oduševljeni su njenim izborom, Matic ih je kupio neposrednošću, skromnošću, ali i načinom na koji tretira Teodoru. Najbitnije im je da je ona srećna i zadovoljna, a kraj njega zaista blista, to svi primećuju. Kako je još izvor rekao, iako Goca Džehverović obožava zeta, pomalo strahuje da bi njena ćerka zbog eventualne trudnoće u budućnosti mogla da zapostavi karijeru: - Goca ne bi imala ništa protiv kada bi joj ćerka rekla da se udaje, ali smatra da ne sme da zapostavi karijeru. Teodora joj stalno priča da joj je proradio majčinski instinkt, pa Goca brine da bi sav trud uložen u njenu dosadašnju karijeru mogao da padne u vodu. Samo za stan u luksuznom beogradskom naselju iskeširala je oko 250.000 evra, a o pesmama i spotovima da i ne govorimo. Ove tvrdnje potvrdila je i sama Teodora, priznavši da bi volela da se mlada ostvari u ulozi majke. - Oduvek mi je bila želja da budem mlada mama. Ne mogu da preciziram godine, jer su jedno želje, a drugo mogućnosti, to su stvari koje ne možemo planirati. Istina je da jedva čekam da postanem majka. Želim da se ostvarim i u poslovnom smislu, ali i kao majka i žena, smatram da je to veoma važno - rekla je nedavno Teodora, piše  .

Ipak, ljubav prema sceni ni danas nije izgubio, pa se vratio na velika vrata! Snimio je pesmu \"U moje vreme\" koja ima šaljiv tekst. Dača poredi njegovo i današnje vreme, a u spotu se našla i njegova ćerka, koja se pojavljuje već u prvom kadru i govori: - Tata, rekla mi je nastavnica muzičkog da si bio popularan u tvoje vreme. Kako je to bilo? - govori ona, nakon čega počinje pesma o Dačinom životu, što možete poslušati u snimku ispod. Podsetmo, Dača je grupu \"Duck\" osnovao 1995. godine. Smenjivale su se mnoge pevačice, ali je on bio stalan član. Grupa ima ukupno osam albuma, a poslednji su izdali 2003. godine.

Komunikacija između Huse i policajca postala je viralna. Stariji gospodin imena  vozio se australijskim putevima na svom skuteru iako nije imao dozvolu za vožnju, a skuter nije bio ni registrovan. Uz sve to, Husina kaciga nije zadovoljavala sigurnosne standarde. Svima je zapalo za oko njegovo ponašanje tokom razgovora sa policajcem po imenu Deni. Naime, Huso je pokušao da se izvuče pričajući mešavinu bosanskog i engleskog jezika, ali mudra taktika mu nije prošla.  Dok je policajac, na engleskom jeziku, pokušao to objasniti starcu, ovaj ga je samo bledo gledao. - Kuda idete gospodine? Da li imate dozvolu? - pitao ga je policajac. - Nemam dozvolu, neregistrovan je. - Zašto onda vozite? I šta vam je to na glavi, šta je to? To nije kaciga za motor već za bicikl. Mogu li da vidim? Ukoliko padnete, ova kaciga vam neće pomoći. Možete poginuti - upozorio ga je čuvar reda. Potrudio se da objansi Husi da mu je odgovarajuća oprema neophodna za vožnju skutera, a  gospodin je to prihvatio s dozom sumnje. Dok je policajac pričao Huso je pokušao da upali motor i ode. - Ne možete nigde da idete, parkirajte skuter pored. Sačekajte trenutak, kažem vam. Molim Vas dajte mi dokumenta - nastavio je policajac. U tom trenutku policajac je pozvao nekoga da mu pomogne oko konverzacije, a kada mu je konačno objasnio čovek iz BiH nije imao kud. On je od nemoći počeo nešto da objašnjava i smekša policiju kako nebi dobio kaznu. - Ja sam Huso Sidran iz Hercegovinem, iz Bosne...Ma daj, bolan, pusti me u pi**u materinu. Ja ovako vozim 15 godina - nastavio je on. - No spik ingliš. Ne mogu, ne mogu.

Lumer je, takođe, napisala i da migranti iz Haitija ne jedu samo pse i mačke: „Jedu ljude.“ U drugim objavama sugerisala je da su visoki američki zvaničnici bili umešani u napade 11. septembra 2001. godine i da je demokratski predsednik Džo Bajden (81) bio iza napada na Trampa, prenosi  . . - Ne znam mnogo o tome - rekao je 78-godišnji Tramp i dodao: - Ne znam šta je rekla, ali to nije moja stvar.

Zatečena je sa ranom od noža na vratu, a ispred kuće stajao je njen sin Kolin (17) koji je bio je prekrivljen krvlju. - Vikali su jedno na drugo u dvorištu, a onda ju je dečak uhvatio za kosu i odvukao u kuću. Ona je zapomagala \"pusti me, pusti me\". Nakon toga je dečak zatvorio vrata - ispričale su komšije, prenosi  Deečak je sam nazvao 911 i rekao je da ga je majka napala nožem i da je pala na nož i tako preminula. Policajci su brzo stigli na mesto nesreće, ali dečak nije hteo da kaže šta se dogodilo. Rekao je da želi dvokata. Inspektori su brzo shvatili da dečakova verzija priče da je majka pala na nož ne odgovara onome što se dogodilo, a to je potvrdio i nalaz obdukcije. Veštak je otkrio da je žena preminula od duboke rane na vratu koja ne odgovara priči da je sama pala na nož. Optužili su ga za ubistvo prvog stepena i traže da mu sude kao odraslom. Dečakova baka je vlasnica kuće, ali nije bila kod kuće kad se ovo dogodilo. Policiji je ispričala da su se Kolin i njegova majka često svađali i da je on imao problema. Samo dan pre ubistva, Ketrin je na Instagramu objavila fotografiju sa sinom. -   - napisala je majka stih iz pesme Tejlor Svift 'It's time to go'. Prošle godine Kolin je pucao u svog oca Čarlsa u Oklahomi. Policiji je ispričao da ga je otac napao u spavaćoj sobi pa je uzeo pištolj i pucao u njega dvaput, jednom u grudi i jednom u glavu. Imao je tada 15 godina, a njegova majka platila je 50 hiljada dolara kaucije kako bi sin izašao i branio se sa slobode. Optužbe protiv njega su odbačene, a tačno godinu dana nakon što je ubio oca, došao je da živi kod majke. Sad je i nju ubio.

    "Article Content": "Ciklon Boris je već izazvao haos u srednjoj Evropi, a ekološke vlasti u Rumuniji su na oprezu.  U Rumuniji, meteorolozi su izdali narandžasta upozorenja za kišu i poplave, . Očekuju se intenzivne padavine sa rizikom od poplava i niskim temperaturama. U Italiji, turisti su bili iznenađeni slojem snega od oko 30 centimetara, dok je u Austriji snega bilo još više. U Češkoj i Poljskoj, ciklon donosi obilne kiše sa akumulacijama vode koje bi mogle dostići do 400 litara po kvadratnom metru. Vlasti se boje da bi poplave mogle biti uporedive sa razornim iz 1997. godine. U galeriji fotografija možete videti kakvo je trenutno stanje u Češkoj. Stanovništvu se savetuje da prati uputstva lokalnih vlasti i pripremi se za ekstremne vremenske uslove, koji bi mogli ozbiljno uticati na infrastrukturu i zajednice u pogođenim oblastima prenose rumunski mediji. Ciklon se kreće prema severu, severoistoku, zadržaće se neko vreme u Istočnoj Evropi, a zatim skrenuti prema zapadu. Ova situacija obično donosi obilne kiše, katastrofalnih razmera, rekao je Tomáš Hrdinka, hidrološkinja iz TGM istraživačkog instituta. Ciklon Boris, sistem niskog pritiska visoke intenziteta, bio je jedan od najznačajnijih vremenskih fenomena koji su pogodili regione u blizini Indijskog okeana. Formiran u ranoj fazi sezone ciklona,  Ciklon Boris formiran je u tropskom regionu Indijskog okeana, inicijalno kao oblast niskog pritiska. Povoljni uslovi, kao što su visoke temperature okeanske vode i povoljni vetrovi, pomogli su u njegovoj intensifikaciji, pretvarajući ga u snažan ciklon. Njegov put uključivao je prolazak kroz nekoliko ostrva i obalnih regiona, izazivajući zabrinutost i pripreme za hitne intervencije u pogođenim oblastima. Suočeni sa ciklonom takve magnitude, lokalne i međunarodne vlasti mobilisale su resurse za upravljanje vanrednom situacijom. Informativne kampanje i kampanje za rano upozorenje bile su ključne za pripremu stanovništva i smanjenje rizika. Nakon prolaska ciklona, sprovedene su operacije spasavanja i oporavka kako bi se pomoglo pogođenim zajednicama da se obnove. Pored toga, humanitarne organizacije i međunarodne agencije pružile su pomoć i resurse za podršku naporima obnove. Hrvatska konkretno nije prošla teško kao što je prošlo sedište Evrope, rekao je za 24sata glavni direktor DHMZ-a Ivan Güttler. Otkrio je da će subota, što se tiče padavina, biti nešto mirnija, dok se nastavak većih očekuje krajem današnjeg dana i u nedelju. - Treba obratiti pažnju na vetar, buru i severna strujanja. U Hrvatskoj će biti značajnih padavina, ali ništa alarmantno. Puno više pratimo šta se dešava u centralnoj Evropi, gde su zaista ekstremne količine padavina, pa će to povećati pritisak i na naše reke, prvenstveno mislim na Dunav - rekao je šef DHMZ-a. Republički hidrometeorološki zavod ( ) upozorio je na obilne padavine danas i sutra na širem području Srbije, kao i na jak i olujni vetar na području Vojvodine i Zapadne Srbije. Večeras i u toku noći, kao i sutra, na području Vojvodine, Mačve, Šumadije, kao i na teritoriji Beograda očekuje se veća količina padavina, od 20 do 40 mm za period od 24 -36 sati, a na području Braničevskog okruga, lokalno i preko 40 mm, navodi RHMZ. Krajem dana i u toku noći ka nedelji, na području Vojvodine i zapadne Srbije duvaće jak severozapadni vetar, koji će u nedelju imati udare olujne jačine.

Njegov put uključivao je prolazak kroz nekoliko ostrva i obalnih regiona, izazivajući zabrinutost i pripreme za hitne intervencije u pogođenim oblastima. Suočeni sa ciklonom takve magnitude, lokalne i međunarodne vlasti mobilisale su resurse za upravljanje vanrednom situacijom. Informativne kampanje i kampanje za rano upozorenje bile su ključne za pripremu stanovništva i smanjenje rizika. Nakon prolaska ciklona, sprovedene su operacije spasavanja i oporavka kako bi se pomoglo pogođenim zajednicama da se obnove. Pored toga, humanitarne organizacije i međunarodne agencije pružile su pomoć i resurse za podršku naporima obnove.

Na taj način je praktično potvrdio da ta pomenuta povreda nije glavni razlog što je odbio da igra za Zmajeve protiv Holandije, što je izazvalo velike potrese kada je u pitanju sam Ahmedhodžić i reprezentacija. Najpre se oprostio od nacionalnog tima zbog uvreda koje je dobijao,  , a za sve je krivio njegovu ženu, Crnogrku Marijanu, koja je između ostalog prešla u islam zbog njega. Njegov život je nekoliko dana ličio na sapunicu, mnogi su ga u BiH isprozivali zbog onoga što je uradio, a čak je i otac Mirsad javno rekao da je od njega tražio da proveri DNK i uveri se da li je dete koje ima sa marijanom definitivno njegovo. U međuvremenu, Ahmedhodžić u Engleskoj uživa veliko poštovanje navijača Šefilda koji su očigledno shvatili šta se dešava u njegovom životu i pružili su mu podršku. Nakon utakmice su ga pozvali da dođe do njih, a dok ih je pozdravljao skandirali su mu \"Anel Ahmedhodžić.\" Na tribinama je viđena i zastava BiH, dok se i supruga Marijana oglasila na Instagramu i podelila detalje sa stadiona.

Napad na nju i njenog saputnika dogodio se oko 18 časova po lokalnom vremenu na putu između grada Daule i grada Gvajakil, gde se nalazi Kazneno-popravni dom Litoral. Ikaza je išla ka bolnici Guasmo Sur, koja se nalazi na jugu Gvajakila, kada su, prema lokalnim medijima, naoružani napadači presreli vozilo i pucali na nju, dok je sedela na mestu suvozača. Prvobitno je SNAI izvestio da je Ikaza preživela i da je prebačena u bolnicu, ali je kasnije potvrđeno da je mrtva prenosi  . Ministarstvo unutrašnjih poslova izrazilo je žaljenje zbog njenog ubistva i uputilo saučešće njenim voljenima i prijateljima. Ovo je drugo ubistvo zatvorskog službenika u poslednjih devet dana, nakon što je Aleks Guevara, direktor zatvora Lago Agrio u amazonskoj provinciji Sucumbíos, ubijen u sličnim okolnostima 3. septembra. Kazneno-popravni dom Litoral, zvanično poznat kao Guayas Muški Centar za Lišenje Slobode Broj 1, je najveći od pet zatvora koji čine zatvorski kompleks u Gvajakilu i smešta oko 12.000 zatvorenika. Više od 6.000 zatvorenika se nalazi u Kazneno-popravnom domu Litoral, koji je između 2021. i 2023. godine bio mesto najgorih masakra izazvanih sukobima između kriminalnih bandi koje su se borile za unutrašnju kontrolu, bar do militarizacije ovih centara koju je na početku godine naredio predsednik Daniel Noboa. Ulazak vojske u zatvorske objekte deo je okvira vanrednog stanja i \"unutrašnjeg oružanog sukoba\" koji je predsednik proglasio protiv organizovanog kriminala, što se pripisuje porastu kriminalnog nasilja koje je dovelo Ekvador do toga da bude zemlja u Latinskoj Americi sa najvećom stopom ubistava. Tokom prošle godine je iznosila 47,2 na 100.000 stanovnika. Talasi ubistava prethodno je odneo živote i drugih zatvorskih direktora, kao i opštinskih vlasti, uključujući nekoliko gradonačelnika, i nacionalnih zvaničnika, kao što je predsednički kandidat Fernando Villavicencio. Ubistvo Marije Daniel Icaza je najnoviji događaj u krizi u zatvorima koju Ekvador doživljava od kraja 2020. godine, okarakterisana nasiljem bandi, neredima i direktnim napadima na zatvorske vlasti. 12. septembra dronom je bačena bomba na najzaštićeniji zatvor u Ekvadoru, La Roca. Detonacija je uništila krov zatvora, što je dovelo do evakuacije zatvorenika i premeštanja Hosea Adolfa Maciasa Villamara (Fito), vođe najveće i najstarije kriminalne bande Ekvadora - Los Choneros. 3. oktobra ubijen je čuvar u zatvoru \"El Rodeo\", smeštenom u glavnom gradu priobalne provincije Manabí.7. oktobra šest kolumbijskih ubica, za koje se sumnja da su učestvovali u ubistvu predsedničkog kandidata Fernanda Villavicencia, pronađeni su obešeni u Kazneno-popravnom domu Litoral, dok je drugi optuženik u istom slučaju ubijen u zatvoru El Inca u Quitu.8. novembra Fredi Ančundia, identifikovan od strane vlasti kao vođa kriminalne bande poznate kao 'R7' i optužen za izazivanje nekih od zatvorskih masakara koji su se dogodili u Ekvadoru prethodnih godina, pronađen je obešen u Regionalnom zatvoru u Gvajakilu .27. novembra jedan od zatvorenika ubija drugog tokom nereda u zatvoru Lago Agrio, nakon što je objekat napadnut eksplozivnom napravom ispaljenom iz drona. 7. januara potvrđeno je bekstvo 'Fita' iz Regionalnog zatvora u Gvajakilu 8. januara počinje niz simultanih nereda u zatvorima koje kontroliše kriminalna banda Los Lobos, sa oko 200 talaca, uključujući policajce, čuvare i zatvorske zvaničnike, koji su trajali oko nedelju dana. Najmanje dvojica zatvorenika i jedan čuvar su ubijeni, dok je oko stotinu zatvorenika u bekstvu 15. januara je počela militarizacija zatvora, koju je naredio predsednik Daniel Noboa u okviru vanrednog stanja i \"unutrašnjeg oružanog sukoba\" proglašenog protiv organizovanog kriminala, s ciljem preuzimanja kontrole nad zatvorima od bandi i oduzimanja njihovih oružja, pri čemu se beleže pritužbe na kršenje ljudskih prava.16. januara je ubijen zatvorski čuvar u amazonskom gradu Lago Agrio. 28. marta u neredima u regionalnm zatvoru u Gvajakilu ubijena su tri zatvorenika, a šestoro drugih je povređeno.21. aprila direktor zatvora El Rodeo je ubijen tokom dana glasanja za referendum koji je sazvao predsednik Daniel Noboa kako bi odobrio reforme za jačanje borbe protiv organizovanog kriminala, uključujući povećane vojne kontrole oko zatvora.1. maja izbila je humanitarna kriza u zatvorima. Izveštaji ljudskopravaških organizacija upozoravaju na ozbiljnu humanitarnu krizu u ekvadorskim zatvorima, ukazujući na nedostatak pristupa pijaćoj vodi, hrani i adekvatnoj medicinskoj nezi za zatvorenike. 22. jula naoružana grupa upala je u zdravtsveni centar u Gvajakilu kako bi omogućila bekstvo četvorici od pet zatvorenika koji su trebali da prime medicinsku pomoć.31. avgusta dva čuvara koja su radila u Litoralu su ubijena u Gvajakilu. 3. septembra direktor zatvora Lago Agrio u amazonijskoj provinciji Sucumbíos ubijen je u napadu, u kojima su druga dva zatvorska radnika povređena. 5. septembra, po drugi put u manje od godinu dana, bačena je bomba dronom na krov zatvora La Roca. 12. septembra direktor Kazneno-popravnog doma Litoral ubijen je u napadu koji se pripisuje kriminalnim bandama koje deluju unutar i van zatvorskog sistema.

The same NFC technique is used in gaming controllers and headphones to enhance compatibility with paired devices. The mTap Digital Business Card works by drawing it closer to the NFC-enabled smartphones. After tapping it on your phone, a notification pops up, and then all the business-related contact details appear on the mobile screen, containing the address, company name, designation, social media links on all registered portals, and work-related links at the receiving end.

Click \"continue,\" and then select \"yes\" to allow the AI to automatically pull your LinkedIn profile, profile picture, logo, and social media handles. mTap automatically applies your brand colors to your profile by analyzing the logo. Then edit your profile to include pictures, contact details, calendar links, presentations, brochures, images, videos, text, and other links you wish to share with your prospects. In the \"Manage Links\" section, mTap allows adding and organizing all necessary links. The profile can be previewed by tapping on the 'Preview' option.

Kenan ide na prodor, ali promašuje novi pokušaj nečega što je ličilo na flouter. Bejkon uzima pretežak šut i dolazi do dva poena. Daum ide prelepo na prodor po prijemu lopte, polaže i pogađa. Pokušava Kenan ponovo za tri poena, ali opet promašuje, Zvezda trenutno ima 0/7 sa distance. Veoma čvrsto se igra, ali sudije ne dopuštaju to i brzo se prave faulovi. Jago pokreće prvi napadm, lopta do Plavšića, ali odbrana je iskočila i uradila dobar posao. Daum diže sa jedne noge u padu i pogađa poludistancu preko ruke. Zaharov pravi faul na Kenanu koji je ukrao loptu za dobar kontranapad. Bio je poslednji igrač odbrane i napravio je faul sa leđa. Precizan Kenan oba puta. Fauliran je Davidovac i imaće dva nova bacanja, a faul je nesportski, tako da će nakon toga imati i loptu sa strane. Precitan je samo u drugom pokušaju. Faul na Kenanu pravi Mun, dosta jak faul Muna. Nova bacanja, dosta loš ritam utakmice. Precizan Kenan sa bacanja oba puta. Spelman diže, pa promašuje trojku, Miler-Mekintajer ide na zakucavanje i odlično. Izgleda da su pukle arkade. Bilo je i krvi. Jedan igrač Zenita je morao da napusti teren. Lopta stiže do Plavšića od Kodija i nova dva laka poena. Kalinić uzima flouter preko ruke, ali promašuje. Mun ide u solo napad protiv Dauma i fauliran je Amerikanac. Zenit će imati dva slobodna bacanja. Mun pogađa svoje prvo slobodno bacanje u četvrtom pokušaju na ovom meču.

Sada izbacuje loptu na tri poena za Davidovca, ali ovaj promašuje taj šut. Pojtres postiže laka dva poena i tako vraća Zenit na samo poen zaostatka. Ide tajmaut Janisa Sferopulosa.

Mekintajer organizuje novi napa, pas za Kalinića, pa napadom u trouglu lopta ide do Mitrovića za laka dva poena. Diže i pogađa trojku ekipa Zenita, a onda na drugoj strani Zvezda vraća za dva. Jago pokreće novi napad nakon dobre odbrane, ali flouterom promašuje ceo koš i lopta je opet za Zenit. Za sada Zvezda ne briljira, ne igraju loše, ali fale dobri napad i dobre odluke. Rampa Mitrovića, Kodi ulazi u kontranapad, lopta do Dobrića i biće dva slobodna bacanja. Precizan je oba puta. Novi kontranapad vodi Kodi i faulira ga Hanter, lopta je sa strane. Gube loptu, Hanter je krade i ide na zakucavanje. Nezgodan pad za Trenta Frejžera, nakon čega se držao za vrat i morao je da napusti teren. Dosta je ugruvan bivši igrač FMP-a. Dobio je dva bacanja, ali šutiraće neko drugi, precizni su oba puta. Odlična igra između Dobrića i Mitrovića, kombinacija i dupli pasovi dali su laka dva poena.

Pored posetilaca iz Rumunije, očekuje se i oko 10.000 posetilaca iz svih ostalih krajeva jer Brenini koncerti su spektakl. Lepa Brena je preko 40 godina na sceni. Iza sebe ima brojne uspehe, koncerte na punim stadionima, arene, filmove koji se sa istim žarom emituju i gledaju i dan danas, ima najtiražnije albume, velike turneje… I sve je to samo deo onog što čini karijeru naše poznate pevačice.

U videu od 45 minuta koje je za nekoliko sati pogledala desetina hiljada ljudi, čuveni Vova je obišao delove Beograda koji nisu turistički -  buvljake, nehigijenska naselja, divlje deponije. Prčao je i o sukobima Srba sa pridošlim Rusima, zamerkama koje dobijaju, automobilima na ulicama koje je opisao rečju \"smeće\", bučnim komšijama u zgradama, lenjim srpskim radnicima i mnogo čemu drugom. Neki će reći da je preterao, a neko da je ukazao na naše nedostatke i minuse. Mnogi Rusi su mu se požalili da ih Srbi kritikuju što se ne integrišu, a jedan od Rusa u snimku, koje je jutjuber intervjuisao, bio je šokiran prizorom sa buvljaka -   tvrdi da je tamo video veštačku vaginu. Komentari na snimak su raznovrsni - od \"ahahahaha, za 550 evra iznajmljuju ovu štalu sa psima u dvorištu i bubašvabama?! Bože, kako nas muzu, ljudi deluju OK, ali kako pristati na takve uslove?\" \"Selektivno negativno subjektivno iskustvo više ljudi. Odvratno. Ovde se uopšte ne radi o Srbiji\", glasio je drugi komentar. \"Momci kojima su po želji isključili muziku imali su veliku sreću. Normalno je da se ovde postavljaju koncertne ulične zvučnike i pali turbo-folk po celoj ulici (da se čuje kilometar unaokolo) cele noći. Došli smo do njih i zamolili ih da utišaju oko ponoći, kada smo shvatili da niko neće zaustaviti zabavu - gledali su nas potpuno bez razumevanja :). Rekli su dođi kod nas na rakiju, rođendan nam je. Bili smo kao - ehhh, napolju je noć, stišaj, ne. Na kraju, žurka je trajala do 2 sata ujutru, dok neko od meštana nije izdržao i pozvao policiju, svaka čast, došli su, ne baš brzo, ali su došli.

Ukoliko bolest nije na vreme registrovana i lečena na odgovarajući način, pacijent može da umre usled teške dehidracije.  Veliki broj zaraženih nema simptome bolesti, dok se kod jednog broja pacijenata javlja akutna dijareja i teška dehidracija. Stručnjaci naglašavaju da je kolera bolest koja se lako leči, ali „ako se ne leči, može da ubije čoveka u roku od nekoliko sati“. Prema podacima stručnjaka, 1 od 10 ljudi bolesnih od kolere razviće ozbiljne simptome. Kod onih koji imaju simptome, smrt može nastupiti u roku od nekoliko sati ukoliko se ne počne sa odgovarajućim lečenjem. Tokom 2020. godine, od kolere je umrlo 857 osoba u 24 zemlje. Veruje se da je stvarni broj mnogo veći, navodi Svetska zdravstvena organizacija. Kolera je teška akutna crevna bolest a praendemsko žarište kolere je delta Ganga i Bramaputre. Izazivač je Vibrion cholerae, gram-negativni, aerobni bacil, klasičnog ili El Tor biotipa.  Česta i   povraćanje i jaki stomačni grčevi su mogući znaci bolesti. Stručnjaci savetuju da se u rizičnim zemljama pije flaširana, prečišćena voda i da se vodi računa o higijeni. Vakcinacija pruža privremenu zaštitu osobama za koje postoji veliki rizik od inficiranja, ili im je oslabljen imunitet. Pre dve godine, u   Serološkim testovima  , potvrđeno je da se radi o koleri. Kineski stručnjaci su preuzeli, kako naglašavaju, sve neophodne mere kako bi se pronašli kontakti i zaustavilo moguće širenje bolesti. Za sada nisu otkriveni novi slučajevi kolere, a posle lečenja, stanje pacijenta kod kojeg je potvrđena kolera je „ „, saopštilo je Okružno odeljenje za zdravstvo Univerziteta Vuhan. Nakon efikasne dijagnoze i lečenja, stanje pacijenta je postalo stabilno, a simptomi su nestali, saopštio je lokalni Centar za kontrolu i prevenciju bolesti.  Poslednji slučajevi kolere u Srbiji zabeleženi su 1989. godine kada je registrovano 16 slučajeva u Dimitrovgradu. Takođe, 1984. su registrovana dva slučaja kod naših građana koji su se oboleli vratili u zemlju i koji su se zarazili na putovanju u zemlje u kojima je kolera endemska bolest. \"Mi naših slučajeva kolere nismo imali u dugom vremenskom periodu, tako da nema osnova za strah, ali da je neophodna opreznost, posebno kada putujemo u rizična područja\", napomenula je u februaru ove godine u Jutarnjem programu dr Violeta Rakić, specijalista epidemiologije sa Instituta za javno zdravlje „Dr Milan Jovanović Batut“.

Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. , koje se suočava sa velikim  Nemački kancelar Olaf Šolc rekao je na zajedničkoj konferenciji za novinare u Berlinu sa kenijskim predsednikom Vilijamom Rutom da zahvaljujući ovom sporazumu, kvalifikovani radnici će moći da dođu u Nemačku, a mladi ljudi će moći da dođu na studije. Prema rečima kancelara, ova saradnja može pomoći u ublažavanju nedostatka radne snage, čiji efekti su već osetni u nemačkoj ekonomiji, izveštava MTI, a prenosi  . - Osnova naše sreće je to što smo otvoreni prema svetu, i moramo očuvati to - izjavio je Šolc, dodajući da je, pored otvorenosti, veoma važno jasno ograničiti ilegalnu imigraciju. Nemački kancelar je rekao da sporazum takođe obezbeđuje da se oni koji nezakonito borave u Nemačkoj mogu efikasnije da se vrate u Keniju. Viliam Ruto pohvalio je \"ogroman ljudski kapital\", inovativnu snagu i kreativnost svoje zemlje. Istakao je da je prosečna starost stanovništva u Keniji 20 godina. Nemačka vlada je već potpisala slične sporazume o migraciji sa Indijom, Marokom i Gruzijom, a sledeće nedelje će potpisati ugovor sa Uzbekistanom. Takođe se priprema slična saradnja sa Moldavijom, Kirgistanom i Filipinima. Prema  , Kenija ima 56.658.088 stanovnika. Prosečna plata u Keniji varira u zavisnosti od nekoliko faktora kao što je iskustvo, industrija u kojoj radi, kao i na kojoj lokaciji ali i nivo obrazovanja. Prosečna mesečna plata u Keniji, u različitim sektorima, procenjuje se između 30.000 i 130.000 kenijskih šilinga (KES) mesečno piše na sajtu  . Ovakav potez se verovatno može osetiti i na koži naših gastarbajtera, jer sada u Nemačku stiže radna snaga koja je radila za 200 evra mesečno! Inače, pretpostavlja se da u Nemačkoj živi između 400.000 i 800.000 Srba. Podsetimo, Nemci su 1. juna uveli novi zakon o useljavanju kvalifikovanih radnika, koji ima za cilj da privuče više kvalifikovanih radnika iz zemalja koje nisu članice EU-a, što je i te kako značajno za Srbiju. Prema podacima iz avgusta, tzv. kartice prilike izdato je skoro 200 viza po ovoj pravnoj osnovi, navelo je tada Ministarstvo spoljnih poslova. Postoje i poeni za kvalifikacije u deficitarnim zanimanjima. Svako ko ima dovoljan broj poena može doći u Nemačku i onda ima godinu dana da traži stalni posao. Pod određenim uslovima moguće je jednokratno produženje za dve godine. (Telegraf Biznis) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ).

Nema od tog posla, tako je i kanada htela da resi problem radne snage sa Indijcima pa napravila sebi problem... Indijci, afrikanci generalno nisu neki radnici na koje se mozes osloniti... Evo da vam kažem,to sto dodje prvo treba stan da nadje koji je za jednisoban stan najmanje 600€ hladan.A ako se uma porodica dodje j do 1500€,zavisi gde.Kada se tome dodaju troškovi struje goriva i hrane.ispod 1800€ samac a porodica ispod 3000€ ne može da živi..Tako da ko god dodje i misli da je to lako..Zajebao se Ne vidim da razlikuju se plate u Keniji i Srbiji.. Odlično je poznato da na jugu Srbije su plate užas pa i tih 250evra (konkretno u Pazaru, radnice u marketima, trafikama, radi se za pola minimalca), malo severnije zarade rastu.. Međutim ne preko tih 950 evra kao u Keniji, profesori u srednjim skolama, medicinsko osoblje, uzeo sam ih kao najplacenije u našem društvu..

    "Article Content": "Predrag Tomović, Vladanov branilac potvrdio je da će se u daljem toku postupka njegov klijent braniti sa slobode. - Svedoci su saslušani pa su prestali razlozi za određivanje pritvora tako da je moj klijent izašao na slobodu.  : - Vladan je najbolji čovek! - kazao je Tomović. , za koje je propisana kazna zatvora od deset godina do doživotne robije, kako je Više javno tužilaštvo okvalifikovalo ovaj događaj. - Tužilaštvo je kvalifikaciju dela zasnovalo na motivu, da je Vladan navodno   Tvrdim da to nije tačno,  . Dejana su se svi plašili, Vladan je tako odreagovao   a ne u nameri da mu se sveti zbog onog što je prethodno uradio - rekao je Vladanov branilac. Najavio je da će u daljem toku postupka priložiti veštačenje pokojnog Dejana obavljeno nakon što je uhapšen zbog napada na Vladanovu majku u kojem su, kako Tomović kaže, stručnjaci psihijatrijske struke naveli da postoji mogućnost da ponovi delo. - S obzirom na takav stav veštaka, trebalo je da Dejan ostane u pritvoru u kojem je bio zbog napada na Vladanovu majku. Da se to dogodilo, on bi danas bio živ a Vladanu se ne bi sudilo - zaključio je advokat Tomović. Vladan je pre ubistva upozoravao na opasnost koju je, prema njegovoj oceni, predstavljao njegov komšija. -   Njega zakon štiti zato što ima F šifru. Napada decu i žene po selu u mestu Glašinac kod Žitorađa.   Policija kaže da je nemoćna i da nisu nadležni za njegovo hapšenje zato što je on psihički bolesnik. Znači on može da uzme pušku i pobije pola sela, a zakon za njega ne važi - napisao je on na svom FB profilu mesec dana pre ubistva. Kobnog dana Dejan i Vladan su se susreli ispred seoske prodavnice,   Vladan je nakon što je izbo komšiju otišao kući i sam se prijavio policiji.  - Dejana sam sreo slučajno,  . Odredite mi pritvor iako neću ponoviti krivično delo jer ne želim da budem optužen da sam uticao na svedoke. Naprotiv, želja mi je da meštani Glašinca kažu kakav sam ja a kakav je bio Dejan - rekao je tužiocu nakon hapšenja Vladan. Tokom saslušanja pred prokupačkim tužilaštvom bilo je sedamdesetak meštana Glašinca koji su najavili da će oni plaćati advokata i potpisati peticiju za ublažavanje Vladanove kazne.  svoju porodicu i celo selo od tog čoveka koji je terorisao čitav Glašinac - kazao je jedan od komšija osumnjičenog za teško ubistvo.

It is supposed to reflect the health of the listed universe of Indian companies, and hence the broader economy, in all market conditions. Officially called the Nifty50, the index is computed using the free float market capitalisation method, which is essentially the count of shares in active circulation in the market at any given point of time. The Nifty, just like BSE benchmark Sensex, is today used for benchmarking portfolios and returns of mutual fund schemes and launching index funds. The Nifty index was launched on April 22, 1996, with a base value of 1,000 counted from November 3, 1995. Live Nifty quotes are available on NSEIndia.com, ETMarkets.com and numerous other web platforms and TV channels at any point of time. The Nifty brand and indices are managed by the Mumbai-based India Index Services and Products Limited, IISL in short, which itself is a subsidiary of NSE. IISL has a three-tier governance structure comprising the board of directors, the index policy committee and the index maintenance sub-committee. IISL managed some 67 indices under the Nifty brand as of September 30, 2016. IISL rebalances the Nifty index semi-annually. The cut-off dates for the semi-annual review of the index are January 31 and July 31 each year. Average data for the six months ending the cut-off date is considered. The exchange notifies any change in the index four weeks before such changes take effect. There are defined eligibility criteria for selection of Nifty constituent stocks. The liquidity of a stock is measured by the market impact cost, which is essentially the cost involved in transacting a stock. For a stock to qualify for inclusion in the Nifty50, it must have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less for six months and for 90 per cent of observation cases. Besides, the company must have a listing history of at least six months. However, a newly-listed company, which has just got listed through the IPO route, may become eligible for inclusion in the index, if it fulfils the normal eligibility criteria for a three- month period instead of six months. Only those stocks which are eligible for trade in the F&O segment of NSE are considered for inclusion as Nifty constituents. As of September 20, 2017, the Nifty had 35.73 per cent components from the financial services sector, 14 per cent from the energy sector, 11.46 per cent from the information technology sector, 10.64 per cent from the automobile sector and 10.13 per cent from the consumer goods sector. Six of the nine BFSI companies in the Nifty50 were private banks. The Nifty index also has several variants such as Nifty Junior, Nifty50 USD, Nifty50 Total Returns index and NIFTY50 Dividend Points Index. BROWSE COMPANIES:",

The rush for such small SUVs underscores a broader shift towards SUVs from traditional cars in the world’s third-largest automobile market. It may soon be possible to ascertain the employment and inflation levels or size of the economy or factory output of any district in the country. India is working on mapping economic activity in districts through various statistical surveys planned next year onwards, as it eyes a significant expansion of official statistics coverage.  Donald Trump has proposed granting automatic green cards to foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges, marking a significant shift in his immigration stance. This move aims to retain top global talent and could greatly benefit Indian students who face uncertainty about their post-graduation status in the U.S. The October 2024 U.S. Visa Bulletin shows progress in most employment-based categories, with significant advancements in the EB-3 Worldwide category. USCIS will accept adjustment of status applications based on the dates for filing chart. The bulletin also reflects the culmination of fiscal year 2024 visa limits, impacting many applicants' immigration processes. Eligible foreign nationals facing financial hardship after the death of a partner can soon apply to have their UK settlement application fee waived. This new rule, effective from October 9, aims to provide a fairer and more compassionate approach for those dealing with grief and financial vulnerability.

The 256-gigabyte model is priced at 19,999 yuan, with higher memory options available at 21,999 yuan and 23,999 yuan, as per Reuters. The launch, following a string of successful smartphone releases, highlights Huawei's resilience in overcoming U.S. sanctions and strengthens its position over Apple in China, where consumers have criticized the iPhone 16 for lacking AI features. Apple is still in search of an AI partner in China to enhance its iPhone 16 series, while its AI software, Apple Intelligence, will not be available in Chinese languages until next year.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

    "Article Content": "Oracle announced new capabilities within Oracle Fusion Cloud Customer Experience (CX) that give buyers self-service access to a unified and active view of their commercial relationship with an organization. The latest updates provide buying groups and selling teams with a collaborative commerce solution that delivers a view of quotes, orders, account and contact profiles, subscriptions, renewals, and assets to help drive better outcomes and revenue throughout the life of a business relationship. “By unifying buying, selling, ordering, and billing flows across the organization, we’re enabling enterprise organizations to bring new value to their customers as they build better long-term relationships,” said  . “We’ve spent the last year folding our industry-leading Commerce offering into our unified revenue transformation solution, so now our customers can easily activate a buying channel that handles all the complexities of B2B selling.” The new digital buying experience connects processes and data from customer experience and financial applications in Oracle’s revenue transformation solution to support increasingly sophisticated go-to-market models such as recurring revenue, usage-based, and consumption-based strategies. New use cases include: Self-service access: Helps organizations engage with buyer groups through shared access to quotes, orders, account and contact profiles, subscriptions, and renewals. Assisted buying experiences: Empowers buying groups to engage with selling teams and find a solution to their needs by evaluating product fit, negotiating pricing or terms, or assistance with placing orders. Full-service sales engagements: Empowers sellers to engage buyers with an intelligent, interactive buying experience from sharing quotes and content all the way through onboarding a new account. Generative AI for contract summarization: Helps organizations reduce contract processing time and close deals faster by providing quick answers to contract-related questions, helping sellers and buying groups to track important milestones and obligations, and enables better internal oversight. Generative AI for sellers: Helps sellers quickly capitalize on sales opportunities and efficiently engage with buyers to drive further account expansion by drafting emails, activity summaries, sales executive briefings, and executive summaries for quotes and proposals. Unified CPQ, contracts, and order management: Helps organizations increase the speed and accuracy of transactions, manage complex enterprise sales agreements, and honor pre-negotiated terms during the ordering process by unifying contract management, order management, subscription management and configure, price, and quote (CPQ) capabilities in Oracle Cloud CX. “Revenue leaders are challenged with keeping up with what customers need, when they need it, and how they want to buy it. It gets even more challenging when managing multiple revenue streams, channels, and products,” said  . “It’s great to see Oracle consistently investing in its CX solutions that are now able to make B2B buying much easier, better the experience, and ultimately increase revenue.”  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

The consortium concept within ASIRT gives the members to further deepen the bonding amongst the members. They are active participant in every activity whether it is fun, sports, arts, knowledge, spiritual practices etc. It’s a pleasure to be part of ASIRT, and I’m proud to be a key sponsor for 'The Synergy Biz Conclave 2024' —it’s truly an honor for me. : I am a first-generation entrepreneur and have been honest and driven. While business is important, I focus more on how I can grow as a person. Business, profitability, and making a living will follow naturally. I’m happy to have built something from the ground up, starting from zero. Also, I am looking far beyond this business as well. :  Yes, my son completed his MBA from NMIMS, and has joined Bluecom to support the growth of our dream company. Since the industry is going through a transformation phase, I am happy to see him lead many efforts to grow further. Today, it’s all about a solution-centric approach. Customers no longer want just products; they want comprehensive solutions. This shift is something I expect him to drive within the company. He has the bandwidth to keep up with the latest technology. He is grooming and learning new technologies and initiatives in the market to integrate with his existing portfolio of products. I am looking forward to him as we will reach to new heights under the leadership of the new generation.  : Without their support and confidence, Bluecom would not have reached where it is now. Distribution is Bluecom’s one of the strongest verticals. This is the comprehensive approach that we have reached in the distribution vertical this far. In a highly competitive market like Mumbai, where we focus on niche Lenovo products in distribution, we've managed to reach nearly 550 unique partners in a single quarter which is humungous. To date, we've built relationships with over 8,000 unique partners, demonstrating the kind of market coverage we have. We've been able to succeed because we don’t approach sales in the typical way. For instance, even after six months, if there's an issue with a product, we've offered reversals and ensured service is provided. We’re clearly on the right path, and I’m excited for what’s ahead.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

Our journey in innovation doesn’t stop there; we are continuously advancing in the realm of direct view LED displays.

One of our most groundbreaking achievements is the introduction of our MicroTiles LED. This product represents a significant leap forward in direct view LED technology, offering unique features and unparalleled performance that set it apart in the industry. Our dedication to innovation and quality ensures that we not only meet but exceed the expectations of our clients, solidifying our reputation as a leader in high-brightness and direct view LED solutions in India. Today, we proudly offer what is possibly the largest range of DLP projectors available from any manufacturer, with units spanning from 5,000 to 50,000 lumens. However, our expertise extends far beyond projectors alone. We have distinguished ourselves by providing comprehensive integrated solutions that cater to diverse customer needs. Products like Pandoras Box, Terra, and Mystique exemplify our commitment to delivering turnkey solutions, solidifying Christie's reputation as a one-stop solutions provider. Projection technology continues to play a crucial role in immersive entertainment due to its unparalleled flexibility, seamlessly adapting to both indoor and outdoor environments. Looking ahead, we envision an even tighter integration of projectors with advanced content management and processing solutions, such as our Pandoras Box. This product is specifically designed for immersive environments, ensuring a cohesive and captivating experience for audiences. By combining our extensive range of high-performance projectors with our cutting-edge integrated solutions, we are well-equipped to meet and exceed the evolving demands of the entertainment industry. Projectors are becoming smaller in size but able to output higher lumens, powered by various illumination technologies such as RGB pure laser that pushes the boundaries of color reproduction, brightness, resolution, image uniformity, installation versatility, and operational lifetime. This makes projection technology ideal for the creation of unparalleled shared experiences. We are also seeing greater integration with powerful software tools to simplify the deployment process for live events. Our Christie Mystique automated camera-based alignment software is a case in point. It enables users to quickly install, align, calibrate and maintain multi-projection systems. Additionally, projection technology is increasingly being integrated with AR and VR to create immersive environments. This trend is particularly significant in sectors such as education, training, entertainment, and retail, where it enhances the user experience by blending physical and digital worlds. At the same time, with growing environmental concerns, there is a push towards more energy-efficient and eco-friendly projector designs. Christie projectors are designed with sustainability in mind and the Christie Griffyn 4K50-RGB pure laser projector is a good example. Even though it has a high brightness output of 50,000 lumens, it’s also the most energy-efficient laser projector available today in its class, generating an incredible 15.9 lumens per watt. Comparable projectors in the same class only deliver an average of 10 lumens per watt. Christie will continue to embrace continuous innovation, prioritize customer-centricity, and adopt sustainable practices. We will also maintain our efforts in investing in R&D to advance technologies like RGB pure laser projection, and direct-view LED.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

    "Article Content": "Commvault, released new critical insights from its 2024 Cyber Recovery Readiness Report. This global survey of 1,000 security and IT professionals across 11 countries, reveals interesting behavior changes for organizations that have been breached versus those that have not. The Commvault survey, done in collaboration with GigaOm, shows that organizations that have endured cyber incidents in the past don't want to get burned again. Consequently, they often reassess and invest in cyber resilience and recovery strategies in very meaningful ways. According to the survey: Investments in cyber resilience increase: Organizations that have been breached spend nearly 30% more on cybersecurity measures than those that haven't. More attention is given to understanding data risk profiles: Breached organizations are nearly 2.5 times more likely to prioritize understanding their data risk profiles, which highlight data types and relative levels of risk. Cyber readiness testing is prioritized: Breached organizations conduct more testing to find gaps in their cyber preparedness plans. Twenty percent of organizations that haven't been breached do not test their recovery plan at all, that number drops to just 2% for organizations that have been breached. The impact of these added investments and focus on cyber resilience is significant. According to the survey, breached organizations that have invested in comprehensive cyber recovery plans recover 41% faster than their less-prepared counterparts. In terms of specific recovery times, breached organizations state that they are 32% more likely to recover within 48 hours compared to those that have not been breached – a much better outcome than the recovery times noted by other respondents, which could be three weeks or more. This reduced downtime can translate to significant savings, both in terms of direct financial losses and the preservation of customer trust and brand reputation. \"We've all heard the expression hindsight is 20/20, and that could not be more applicable when it comes to the findings of this survey,\" said  . \"Our survey shows that the most resilient organizations are those that continuously test and refine their recovery strategies, learning from each incident to strengthen their defenses. It's this proactive mindset, rather than reactive spending, that makes the difference.\" Much like health insurance, where the cost of coverage often far outweighs the potential expenses of medical emergencies, cyber recovery readiness serves a similar purpose. The report underscores that the costs of being breached – ranging from operational disruption to regulatory fines – far exceed the expenses of proactive cyber resilience measures. \"The findings should be a call to action for all organizations, not just those that have been breached,\" said  . \"Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and so too must the strategies to counter them. It's about adopting a holistic approach to cyber resilience that integrates people, processes, and technology, ensuring readiness at every level.\" In addition to these findings, Commvault and GigaOm were able to pinpoint five key capabilities, also called resiliency markers, that when deployed together, helped companies recover faster from cyberattacks and experience fewer breaches compared to companies that did not follow the same path. These five resiliency markers emerged after data analysis teams combed through the same survey results across a range of topics including: how often companies were breached, what resilience technologies were (or were not) deployed, and how rapidly businesses were able to recover data and resume normal operations.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt.

    "Title": "AI and Automation Drive 50% Faster Software Development, OutSystems and KPMG Survey Reveals",
    "Author Name": null,
    "Author URL": null,
    "Article Content": "As the reach of artificial intelligence (AI) expands, IT leaders are exploring new use cases for technology used throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), according to a new survey launched today titled “AI in software development: Exploring opportunities and uncertainties” by OutSystems, a global leader transforming how companies innovate through software, and KPMG, a multinational professional services network. The research surveyed 555 software executives around the world whose companies span IT consultancy services, manufacturing, banking, financial services and insurance among others. 84 percent of respondents reported that their organizations first began to incorporate AI technologies in their SDLCs between six months to five years ago, with the earliest adopters primarily being IT services companies. Across regions, EMEA and North America remain roughly on equal footing, while APAC is steadily catching up. The findings show that testing, quality assurance, and security vulnerability detection are by far the most widely adopted use cases for AI in software development. Nonetheless, generative AI (GenAI) is set to transform the industry by significantly enhancing these processes and introducing unprecedented capabilities. Early adopters are planning to increase their use of AI in other stages of the SDLC, such as user interface design, code generation, DevOps optimization, and application maintenance. Nearly all respondents are planning to increase their investment in AI-augmented SDLC management over the next two years, indicating that AI will play a central role in driving innovation and competitive advantage in the software industry. “AI is redefining the impossible,” said Paulo Rosado, CEO and founder at OutSystems. “I’m laser-focused on helping teams compress multi-year legacy modernization projects into just a few months. The latest AI disruptions have brought us the potential to compress these development timelines into even shorter and faster projects. With AI, historically impossible transformation projects are not only possible but easier, cheaper, and faster to accomplish.” “Right now, the developer’s role is shifting from code writer to code reviewer,” said Rodrigo Coutinho, Co-founder and AI Project Manager at OutSystems. “Large language models (LLMs) are a big help, but they still make mistakes. But as these models evolve, and trust in the resulting code improves, the developer’s role will be more akin to that of an orchestrator and acceptance tester of AI-generated outputs.” Despite being a nascent technology a couple of years ago, the report found that confidence in the quality of AI-generated code has risen substantially—half of respondents said that the implementation of AI has improved software quality, enhanced decision-making, and increased efficiency in software testing and quality assurance. But confidence is also paired with risk awareness surrounding tech debt in the form of orphan code and hallucinations, a lack of context for an organization’s specific coding needs, and scalability concerns. With strategy baked into AI in SDLC processes, 56% of respondents said they experienced or expected to experience a higher quality of applications, with fewer bugs and improved performance.   The AI opportunity is undeniably huge, but its wider adoption in other areas of the SDLC beyond software testing and vulnerability detection still face some barriers. Chief among these are data privacy and security concerns (56% of respondents) and regulatory and compliance challenges (42%). Moreover, 38% of executives cite difficulties integrating generative AI into existing workflows as the primary barrier to adoption. “There’s a lot of speculation on what will change with the rise of GenAI,” said Michael Harper, Managing Director at KPMG U.S. “While there will be challenges, those with effective change management initiatives will reskill and upskill their workforces, leading to AI and jobs evolving in tandem.” The speed and sprawl of AI, namely GenAI, is paving the way for an increase in investments for nearly all respondents. But risks concerning the reliability of AI-generated code persist, though they can be mitigated with existing approaches, such as user acceptance testing, unit testing, and regression testing. “It’s up to the developer working with AI to guarantee the quality of the deliverables, but this becomes way more efficient with AI,” said Coutinho. “AI is, in fact, a great partner in creating tests in synthetic data.” Other oft-cited concerns were the limited availability of skilled personnel and difficulties integrating GenAI into existing tech stacks and workflows. Fears of job losses are high as well, with 89% of respondents claiming that certain roles will be eliminated by AI. This falls in line with a broader industry trend over the last couple of years. However, in the longer term, AI may well create more jobs than it displaces, resulting in a new type of developer, equipped with specialized AI skill sets.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

    "Article Content": "We have been contributing to the education industry for a while now, and it was our vision from the beginning to develop our own writing board software with all the latest features. This idea has been with us since we started the operations of our company almost five years ago. Today, I am very happy to say that it has finally been accomplished. This is our contribution to the nation, demonstrating that we are not dependent on any other country for software solutions; we have created our own. 'Mannat' Writing Board software is going to revolutionize the industry as it is the first software integrated with inbuilt content for everything. Currently, we have added NCERT content and plan to include ICSE board content and other curricula. We also aim to convert the content videos into 14 regional languages, making it accessible to a wider audience. Our goal is to make digital teaching available on all panels so that everyone can benefit from it. Over the past 25 years, since the advent of smart classes, there has always been a challenge of using different software for content and writing boards, causing confusion among teachers. With five years of hard work, we have finally integrated a whiteboard with content, making it user-friendly and easy for teachers to use. Before launching, we took feedback from over 200 to 500 teachers by showing them free demos and organizing classes to understand their needs and preferences. Based on their feedback, we have included mathematical tools, chemistry tools, physics tools, images, videos, books, PPTs, 3D images, and more. Previously, various software offered limited features, but now we have consolidated everything into one software, making it a win-win situation for us. As industry leaders, we wanted a leading personality to represent our brand. We didn't want someone who plays a secondary or tertiary role; we wanted a hero. Abhay Deol perfectly fits this image. Additionally, he was my daughter's choice as well, which made the decision even more meaningful. We initially discussed the idea with him last year, and after waiting for a year, we are finally able to bring this collaboration. This product is not only compatible with our hardware, but anyone, any brand, can purchase and use it with their hardware. The idea is that the future battle lies in software, not hardware. While hardware is common among people, software presents a challenge. We have taken the initiative, as we always do, because we are the leaders and must act as such. Others had an equal opportunity to do so, but no one took advantage of it. We believe we have been blessed to do it. The first version is already available, and every month, users will receive a new update. We aim to achieve a market share of 30 to 40% in next one year. In August, we are launching the Android version as well, so anyone can use it on Android or Windows. Initially, we are collaborating with our partners and all the brands associated with us. We provide them with our software, which they can sell under their own branding. We are also offering this as a white-label solution. I believe that within the next year, most brands will be associated with our software and will adopt it. Just like in all government projects where the government has mandated the use of Indian software and products, they require software for both Android and Windows platforms, and both should be the same. I think we will be the only company in India to have this capability. No other company offers software for both Windows and Android with the same specifications and features. While many Chinese companies are doing this, they face restrictions from the government. Therefore, I believe that India will be the only country where a manufacturer will have both Android and Windows versions with the same specs and features. The digital revolution is underway, and we are committed to contributing our best efforts to it. We are not leading a revolution but are merely playing a part in it, striving to add our numbers and efforts to the cause. The success of our contribution relies on the support and love from people and the guidance of God. I promise to India that this year, we will have India's largest IT manufacturing facility in Punjab. We have already acquired the land, and the construction work is underway. This year, we promise to have the largest manufacturing unit in India, located in Punjab. We have already initiated many steps in this direction, and I believe we will be able to start the factory around Diwali. This will be our gift to India. We are also exporting our software application. We have orders from Dubai, and many customers from Dubai are interested. Even our vendors, from whom we buy raw materials, are willing to buy the software under their name. However, my idea was to start from India. Once the software gains popularity in India, we can then expand to other countries. We have already developed a website for online purchases. People can buy online from our Dubai office. We are open to customization requests as well, and we can tailor the software to meet specific needs.  👉  News Dot Media Pvt. Ltd. © 2022-2023 ",

    "Article Content": "Žena koja je nedavno kupila  , suočila se sa ozbiljnim problemom, kada je uvidela da je kiloemtraža vraćena za \"tričavih\" 100.000 kilometara! \"Poštovani, vezano za konstantno aktuelne priče o lažnim kilometražama i ja sam nasela na jednu, ali možda ima izlaza, zato vam se i obraćam. Auto ima kilometražu na meraču 176.000 kilometara, tako sam ga kupila i registrovala. Sat vremena kasnije otvaram ladicu auta i nalazim urednu servisnu knjižicu sa više datuma servisa i zadnji je iz maja rađen na 274.000 kilometara. \"Da nisam saznala, bilo bi mi lakše. Naravno, zvala sam ih, oni, naravno, nisu ništa znali ni garantovali... Registrovana je firma preko koje sam kupila. Da li imam neke zakonske osnove da ih gonim?\", napisala je ona. Kako da prepoznate vraćenu kilometražu? Pre svega, treba da gledate stanje vozila, jer auto koji je prešao više od 1oo.ooo km ne može imati kao nov upravljač. 3 stvari posebno otkrivaju da je auto prešao mnogo čak i kada vas zavaraju kilometražom. A te tri stvari su - istrošenost upravljača, nožnih komandi i ručice menjača. Sve to govori da je automobil prešao mnogo. Ipak, danas je sve to moguće brzo i jeftino srediti, što važi i za sedišta – ukoliko su propala, lako se slepe posebnom penom ili se ubacuju novi sunđeri ili opruge, a zatim se presvuku i deluju kao nova. Presvlače se i vrata, „nebo“ i ostali tapacirani delovi. Ofucani sigurnosni pojasi se takođe lako i jeftino menjaju. Zbog toga ima razloga za sumnju i ukoliko neki delovi enterijera deluju suviše očuvano. Ponekad se čak ubacuju sedišta iz havarisanih ali novijih i očuvanijih vozila. Zato se uvek dobro posavetujte sa svojim automehaničarem, ali u četiri oka. Nijedan prodavac ne voli da ga razotkriju! Nedavno  koje je sprovela automobilska kompanija carVertical u 14 evropskih zemalja otkrilo je da automobili uvezeni u Srbiju imaju veću verovatnoću da im je vraćena kilometraža u poređenju s vozilima kupljenim u zemlji.

    "Article Content": "Poplave prete Evropi, u Rumuniji je sve pod vodom, drama je u Austriji, . Nije tajna da nam polovnjaci najviše dolaze iz Evrope, a budući da Srbi vole da pazare automobile sa Zapada, bitno je proveriti da li su preživeli poplavu ili su sve vreme bili na suvom! Ovo su neki znakovi da je automobil bio poplavljen: Obratite pažnju na koroziju - Automobili u godinama, koji su prešli više stotina hiljada kilometara, sa spoljne strane mogu imati koroziju, ali ne i unutra! Ono što morate da znate jeste, da korozija unutar kabine se ne pojavljuje ni nakon 30 godina vožnje.. Naravno ako automobil nije bio potopljen. Međutim, ukoliko je bio potopljen, koroziju je moguće primetiti u donjim tačkama kabine. U tom slučaju najbolje je detaljno pogledati gepek i prostor oko rezervnog točka. Obavezno podignite rubove tepiha i vidite šta je ispod njih. Za kraj obavezno pogledajte šine sedišta i prostor ispod sedišta (koristite ogledalo i baterijsku lamu ako je nepristupačno). Kako su pomenute šine presvučene najtanjim slojem zaštite, njihova korozija bi mogla da ukaže na to da je automobil bio potopljen. Problem sa elektronikom - Ako majstor ne može da popravi grešku u elektronici, eto vama mogućnosti da je automobil bio poplavljen! Kako instalacije prve stradaju od strane korozije, obavezno je proveriti da li svi pokazivači i sva svetla rade, kako spolja tako i iznutra, potom da li ventilacija i klima rade, zajedno sa upaljačem. Tokom testiranja automobila pre kupovine, obavezno pri paljenju oslušnite da li automobil, tj. njegova elektronika proizvodi neočekivane zvukove, ili neočekivan smrad paljevine, koji može da ukaže na neispravnost elektronike. Promena tepiha, neba i presvlaka - Ukoliko se radi o skupom automobilu, izvlačenje vlage i korišćenje hemikalija nije opcija, već će majstori preko grane posegnuti za promenom tepiha, neba i presvlaka. U slučaju da je automobil stariji od 6-7 godina, lako se može ustanoviti da se radi o novim već pomenutim elementima. Amortizacija oko prostora stopala, i na vozačevom ili suvozačevom mestu, treba treba detaljno da se pregleda, jer ako je automobil vožen više od 6-7 godina, znakovi amortizacije i rabljena moraju da budu prisutni (izlizanost tepiha na pojedinim mestima recimo). Ako su presvlake nove, pa ručno šivene, to može biti \"red flag\" za automobil koji je realno stariji. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ).

Situacija za koju snimatelj nije siguran ko ima prednost je ta da su oba vozila na glavnoj ulici. Snimatelju ta glavna ulica ide desno, a on želi da nastavi pravo na ulicu koja je sporedna. S desne strane mu dolazi automobil koji skreće desno, takođe u tu sporednu ulicu. - Ne mogu da verujem da neko ovo ne zna! Vratite vozačke u policiju, manje ljudi će stradati - piše neko u komentaru, dok se ljudi svađaju i oko pravila koje se gleda u odnosu na ovu situaciju. - Desni auto ima prednost jer radi manji luk - napisao je neko, dok drugi odgovara da snimatelj može slobodno pravo jer mu je iznad znaka - zelena krošnja.

    "Article Content": "Pravilo desne strane je fundamentalno načelo regulisanja saobraćaja, odnono određivanja prvenstva prolaza, u slučajevima kada se ukrštaju putevi iste važnosti. Prva lekcija u auto-školama jeste upravo ta da, ukoliko ne postoji  znak, ili druga oznaka, propustite vozilo koja vam nailazi sa desne strane, u slučaju da nailazite na put iste važnosti. Postoji, međutim, i druga signalizacija koja ima gotovo istu snagu, a da su je vozači potpuno izgubli iz vida. Međutim, u slučaju saonraćajne nesreće možete biti krivi i platiti štetu, a da pojma nemate da ste izazvali udes nepoštujući zakon.  se, naime, deli na vertikalnu signalizaciju i horizontalnu signalizaciju. Bilo da se radi o vertikalnoj ili horizontalnoj saobračajnoj signalizaciji, njena namena je regulisanje ili usmeravanje saobraćaja, obeležavanje vozila ili obezbeđivanje mesta izvođenja radova na kolovozu. Horizontalna signalizacija Horizontalna signalizacija predstavlja skup posebno oblikovanih geometrijskih elemenata linija, figura, polja i natpisa koji formiraju oznake na saobraćajnim površinama. Horizontalna signalizacija postoji i na drugim površinama: parkinzima, trotoarima, komunikacijama unutar garaža, aerodromskim pistama itd. Osnovna podela horizontalne signalizacije potiče od namene oznaka. Ova podela uslovljena je položajem oznaka u odnosu na simetralu kolovoza puta ili ulice: uzdužne oznake(razdelne linije, ivične linije, linije vodilje i sl), poprečne oznake, linije zaustavljanja (ova oznaka se često naziva i \"stop\" linija), pešački prelazi, prelazi biciklističkih staza, kosnici,graničnici, itd. i ostale oznake, strelice, natpisi, polja i linije za usmeravanje, oznake za parkiranje itd. Damir Okanović, direktor Komiteta za bezbednost saobraćaja, navodi da horizontalna signalizacija ima obavezujući karakter. \"Po važećim propisima ako na prilazu raskrsnici nisu postavljeni STOP ili obrnuti trougao, a na kolovozu postoji linija zaustavljanja (zaustavna linija) vozači se obaveštavaju o obavezi zaustavljanja odnosno propuštanja vozila na putu na koji nailaze, samom zaustavnom linijom. Pošto vozač može da ne vidi zaustavnu liniju usled npr. snega na kolovozu ili vozila koje se kreće ispred njegovog, nije dobro da na raskrsnici bude samo zaustavna linija bez znaka STOP ili bez obrnutog trougla. Zbog toga učesnici u saobraćaju kada primete da postoji zaustavna linija a nema znaka STOP ili obrnutog trougla, treba da obaveste upravljača puta kako bi postavili saobraćajni znak\", objašnjava Okanović. Ako blagovremeno uočite zaustavnu liniju na kolovozu, a ne propustite vozila na putu na koji ste naišli, možete prekršajno ali i krivično odgovarati. Zbog toga obratite pažnju i na horizontalnu signalizaciju kada nailazite na raskrnicu, jer može skupo da vas košta.

Najbolje je da ne kupujete \"bolesnike\" odnosno   koji su pregaženi u gradskoj vožnji, kreni-stani, te koji su prešli stotine hiljada kilometara. Ipak, ako niste automehaničar i nemate jednog u familiji, valja znati kako proveriti da li je vaš potencijalni automobil zapravo problematičan iako je naoko lep, našminkan i sa manjom kilometražom. A tu su bitne 3 stvari na polovnom automobilu koje otkrivaju da je porešao mnogo. U suštini, automobil uvek treba razgledati po danu! Bitno je pogledati šasiju, (tzv. VIN), gde treba obratiti pažnju na šire područje oko broja – možda je čitav komad lima sa brojem isečen i zavaren novi ili je na neki drugi način falsifikovan. Proveru možete da obavite u policiji (ima slučajeva da su vozila oduzimana i po godinu ili dve dana nakon što su prošla proveru u policiji) ili u Centru za motorna vozila (CMZ) Auto–moto saveza Srbije. Postoji i stara, ali nepouzdana provera magnetom – ako se magnet ne  lepi za neku površinu, možete posumnjati da se ispod laka nalazi git.

Ipak 3 stvari posebno otkrivaju da je auto prešao mnogo čak i kada vas zavaraju kilometražom. A te tri stvari su - istrošenost upravljača, nožnih komandi i ručice menjača. Sve to govori da je automobil prešao mnogo. Ipak, danas je sve to moguće brzo i jeftino srediti, što važi i za sedišta – ukoliko su propala, lako se slepe posebnom penom ili se ubacuju novi sunđeri ili opruge, a zatim se presvuku i deluju kao nova. Presvlače se i vrata, „nebo“ i ostali tapacirani delovi. Ofucani sigurnosni pojasi se takođe lako i jeftino menjaju. Zbog toga ima razloga za sumnju i ukoliko neki delovi enterijera deluju suviše očuvano. Ponekad se čak ubacuju sedišta iz havarisanih ali novijih i očuvanijih vozila. Zato se uvek dobro posavetujte sa svojim automehaničarem, ali u četiri oka. Nijedan prodavac ne voli da ga razotkriju!

    "Article Content": "Američki Consumer Reports je napravio veliko istraživanje pouzdanosti . Za ovu listu, ispitali su više od 150.000 vozila godišta od 2014. do 2109. u vlasništvu svojih članova, upoređujući broj problema koje je svaki auto imao s prosekom za sva vozila. Ovim procesom su dobijeni rezultati pouzdanosti za svaku marku. Lexus i Toyota bili su najpouzdanije marke polovnih automobila s velikom razlikom u odnosu na sve ostale, potvrđujući svoju reputaciju među kupcima, piše Auto Klub. Stiven Elek, voditelj programa Consumer Reportsa za analitiku podataka o automobilima, rekao je da su ove dve marke poznate po \"konzervativnom postupnom poboljšavanju cijele linije proizvoda, umjesto uvođenja mnogih potpuno novih sustava\". Ovo je lista najboljih marki rabljenih automobila: Dok ove lestvice daju širok pogled na pouzdanost marke, stručnjaci ipak savetuju da se prilikom kupovine istraži svaki model pojedinačno. Osim toga, treba uzeti u obzir i cienu i vrstu popravki. Jedno vozilo može imati više problema s jeftinim popravkama, dok bi drugo moglo biti sklono manjem broju skupih problema.

    "Article Content": " U početku su posmatrane kao eksperimentalna digitalna imovina, kriptovalute su evoluirale u tehnologije vredne trilion dolara sa potencijalom da poremete globalni finansijski sistem.  Kriptovalute su prešle sa digitalnih kurioziteta na sredstva koja se koriste za različite transakcije, uključujući kupovinu softvera i, kontroverzno, ilegalne aktivnosti.   Međutim, kritičari tvrde da oni olakšavaju kriminalne aktivnosti i doprinose nestabilnosti i nejednakosti tržišta. Decentralizovana priroda kriptovaluta, koje funkcionišu na blokčejn tehnologiji, dozvoljava transakcije bez centralnog autoriteta.  Njegova tržišna kapitalizacija odavno premašila 1 milijardu dolara. Druge kriptovalute poput Ethereuma, pa čak i šaljive valute kao što je Dogecoin, takođe su postale popularne. Kao odgovor na bum kriptovaluta, mnoge vlade istražuju uvođenje digitalnih valuta centralne banke (CBDC - Central Bank Digital Currency).   CBDC nude prednosti kriptovaluta brzinu i digitalnu efikasnost, bez povezanih rizika neregulisanih sredstava. Međutim, oni dolaze sa sopstvenim izazovima, uključujući zabrinutost oko centralizacije moći i podataka u jednoj instituciji.  Pored toga, kriptovalute su postale alat za sajber kriminalce, teroriste i odmetničke države da izbegnu sankcije i olakšaju nezakonite aktivnosti.  Neregulisana priroda kriptovaluta dovela je do zabrinutosti zbog prevare, utaje poreza i finansijske stabilnosti.  Uprkos svom potencijalu, kriptovalute kao što je Bitkoin se i dalje prvenstveno koriste za špekulacije, a mnogi investitori se nadaju dugoročnim dobitima zasnovanim na budućim primenama blokčejn tehnologije.

    "Article Content": " Dok pišem ovaj tekst u mislima mi prolaze svi oni trenuci u kojima smo razgovarali, pa i sarađivali. Njegov autorski opus zaista je ogroman i o tome sam više puta pisao. U ovom tekstu pokušaću da vas podsetim na segment njegovog stvaralaštva koji je ovdašnjoj publici svakako manje poznat, ali je zaista izuzetan, a i njemu samom bio je jako važan. Ako govorimo o domaćoj instrumentalnoj muzici koju su stvarali rok muzičari, svakako stoji da ona nije lako pronalazila put do slušalaca, a ako i jeste, to su uglavnom bili gitarski instrumentali. Setimo se recimo kompozicija kao što su \"Dinamit\" Josipa Bočeka, \"Ulazak u harem\" R.M. Točka ili \"Jednoj ženi\" Zlatka Manojlovića. Takođe, tu su i mnoge sjajne obrade iz ovdašnjeg etno nasleđa, poput \"Aber dojde Donke\" grupe Leb i Sol, \"Zajdi, zajdi\" od Smaka, ili izvanredne Točkove solo partije koju je doneo u kompoziciji \"Ukor\". Kasnije su neki od ovih gitarista objavili i svoje instrumentalne albume, a među prvima su to uradili R.M. Točak (1977.), a takođe i Zlatko Manojlović (1980.). O gotovo svim gore navedenim kompozicijama pisao sam tekstove, ali svakako ne treba smetnuti s uma da postoji i izuzetan instrumentalni, autorski opus, koji su u onim zlatnim danima rok muzike ostavili iza sebe neki od naših najpoznatijih klavijaturista. Jedan od prvih solo albuma objavio je Tihomir Pop Asanović (\"Majko zemljo\" 1974.), ali s obzirom da je taj LP pretežno vokalni (izuzev kompozicija \"Berlin I\" i \"Berlin II\"),  Kornelije Kovač svakako spada u red onih pionira koji su se odvažili da krenu u vode instrumentalne muzike Zašto kažem odvažio? Možda je najbolje objašnjenje za to dao sam Kornelije u jednom intervjuu koji sam vodio s njim:  (iz knjige \"Gramofonske priče\", autora Gorana Živanovića) Da je ovo tačno, svedoči i činjenica da je mnogo više onih koji su, nakon prestanka rada Korni grupe, upoznati sa Kornelijevim kompozitorskim radom za naše tada veoma popularne pevače kao što su to recimo Zdravko Čolić, Bisera Veletanlić, Zlatko Pejaković itd, nego sa njegovim solo ostvarenjima. U tekstu koji sledi podsetiću vas na nekoliko kompozicije iz tog opusa. Ovo je prva ploča koju je Kornelije Kovač objavio pod svojim imenom nakon razlaza Korni grupe. Sećam se da sam komoziciju \"Okean\" prvi put čuo kada sam bio osmi razred. Bio sam naprosto očaran. Toliko mi se svideo taj instrumental da sam odmah shvatio kako tu ploču moram imati što pre. Kornelije je ovde po ko zna koji put pokazao koliki je majstor svog zanata. Iako se kompozicija \"Okean\" našla na B strani ovog singla, tih godina mnogo češće je emitovana na talasima radio stanica, mada ni A strana na kojoj je \"Severni vetar\", nije ništa lošija i zvuči stvarno svetski. Ovo je za mene jedan od onih čarobnih singlova iz sedamdesetih godina, ploča koja pokazuje kakvi talenti su stasavali u jednoj relativno maloj zemlji kao što je to Jugoslavija. Nakon ovog fantastičnog singla, mnogi su očekivali (među njima i ja) sledeći Kornelijev potez. U stvari čekao se album. Do realizacije takve ideje nikada nije došlo, a razlozi za to nisu bili do kraja jasni. Tada se govorkalo da je čitav plan propao jer je Dado bio neodlučan, čas je hteo, čas nije, da se priključi grupi. Međutim, Dadovo mišljenje sasvim je drugačije, što mi je i izneo u jednom razgovoru: (misli na gradove u kojima su živeli muzičari koji su trebali da sviraju u K2, op. autora) Interesantno je da će gotovo svi članovi ove zamišljene super grupe svirati na Kornelijevom prvom solo albumu. Dakle, tu su bili gitarista Josip Boček, basista Čarli Novak, klavijaturisti Sloba Marković i Sanja Ilić, bubnjari Lazar Tošić i Ratko Divjak, dok su pevačke deonice podelili Zvezdana Sterle, Nada Žgur i Oto Pestner.  Taj LP je u suštini bio dobar, na njemu je bilo dosta vokalnih kompozicija, ali ruku na srce, čini se da nije bilo neke koja bi mogla da povuče ceo album. U jednom razgovoru upitao sam ga zašto je doneo takvu odluku, kada je ovde već stekao ime vredno svakog poštovanja, njegov odgovor bio je ovakav:  (iz knjige \"Gramofonske priče, autora Gorana Živanovića) LP je kao i prethodni objavila izdavačka kuća PGP RTB i to je stvarno bila odlično urađena ploča. Na ploči se nalazi i par sjajnih instrumentala poput \"Scottish Bird\", a tu je i instrumentalna verzija poznate pesme Korni grupe, \"Put za istok\". Tih godina slušao sam ga jako puno, jednostavno nisam mogao da prestanem. Iako je Kornelije i dalje objavljivao svoja solo ostvarenja, ja ću u ovoj priči upravo ovde stati. Sa ploče\"Sampled Moon\"  gotovo da sam mogao odabrati bilo koju kompoziciju za ovaj prikaz, ipak, odlučio sam se za \"Still Chicken\" i \"Anna F\". Za prvu, mnogi koji su je čuli uopšte i ne znaju da je iz opusa Kornelija Kovača, dok je druga posvećena Ani Frank i jedina je kompozicija na albumu u kojoj je korišćen glas, ali u funkciji instrumenta. Tu deonicu otpevala je Kornelijeva ćerka Aleksandra koja je tada imala samo četrnaest godina. Međutim, isto tako, mogao sam se odlučiti i za nestvarnu \"Get It Right Boy\", ili na primer \"Cola-Kid\", ili za više nego sjajnu \"Dancing On The White Beach\". Interesantno je da je bilo zlobnika koji su tvrdili da je Kornelije inspiraciju za ovu poslednju pronašao u kompoziciji \"Get Out of Your Lazy Bed\", koju je par godina ranije objavila britanska grupa Matt Bianco. Malo šta je delovalo tako opuštajuće i umirujuće kao ova ploča. Bar je kod mene bilo tako. Nažalost, ako na YOU TUBE danas pogledate broj pregleda ovih kompozicija, razočaraćete se. Ta brojka jedva da dostiže nekoliko hiljada (izuzev kompozicije \"Okean\" koja ima nešto više\"), Srećom ima i onih, među koje ubrajam i sebe, kojima ti pregledi apsolutno ništa ne znače i na to se uopšte i ne obaziru. I da: Kornelije je pisao i sjajnu filmsku muziku, zatim špice za mnoge popularne televizijske i radio emisije, i tu takođe ima sjajnih instrumentala, ali o svemu tome možda u nekoj od naših narednih priča. Njegova muzika zauvek će obasjavati ove prostore. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ). Telegraf.rs zadržava sva prava nad sadržajem.

    "Article Content": "Predsednica Pokrajinske vlade   otvorila je večeras u Novom Sadu 17. \"Tamburica fest 2024\", poručivši da je ova manifestacija među najverodostojnijim čuvarima tradicije i kulturnog nasleđa Novog Sada, Vojvodine i Srbije. \"Svojim konceptom i programom, onim što nudi takmičarima i brojnim gostima, i zahvaljujući prepoznatljivosti širom sveta, 'Tamburica fest' je od samog nastanka mnogo više od uobičajenog mesta okupljanja ljubitelja ovog muzičkog instrumenta i njegovog zvuka. I večeras, kao i na svim prethodnim svetkovinama kvalitetne muzike i lepe pesme, svedoci smo da umetnost i kultura predstavljaju jedan od najboljih načina zbližavanja i boljeg upoznavanja raznih naroda\", poručila je Gojković. Ona je istakla da je tamburica, jedan od najstarijih žičanih instrumenata, među najupečatljivijim delovima \"naše muzičke tradicije i kulturnog identiteta\". Gojković je podsetila na to da su očuvanje i negovanje kulturnog nasleđa, kao i njegovo prenošenje generacijama koje dolaze, među ključnim faktorima razvoja svakog društva. \"Briga o zaštiti naše kulturne baštine treba da bude važan zadatak svima nama koji se njome na bilo koji način bavimo. To uključuje i podršku koju Pokrajinska vlada pruža ustanovama, organizacijama i pojedincima koji vredno rade na očuvanju naše muzičke tradicije, među kojima je nesumnjivo i naš ‘Tamburica fest'\", navela je Gojković. Ona je dodala da o značaju tamburice govori i to što je tamburaška praksa 2021. godine upisana u Nacionalni registar nematerijalnog kulturnog nasleđa. Dodala je da su manifestacije poput ove važne, jer spajaju nasleđe sa savremenim stvaralaštvom, čineći tako tradiciju i običaje i \"živim\" i vidljivim, dajući im aktivnu ulogu u nastanku novih umetničkih dela. Na festivalu svake godine nastupaju orkestri iz zemlje i inostranstva u takmičarskom delu programa za najbolji orkestar Svetskog tamburica festa, a vokalni solisti iz celog sveta učestvuju u izboru za najbolju autorsku pesmu Tamburica festa. U okviru ove manifestacije nastala je i Svetska tamburaška asocijacija, udruženje svih tamburaša sveta sa sedištem u Novom Sadu, navodi se u saopštenju Pokrajinske vlade.

Karte su za 13.septembar bile rasprodate, a sledeći datumi kada će se \"Lu\" naći na daskama koje život znače, jesu 14. i 15. septembar, kao i 20. 21. i 22. septembar. - Ovo sam ja... Ovaj teatar je moj konačni odgovor. Možda mi je dugo trebalo da svom ludilu, onom kreativnom pronađem pravi put i pravo odelo i od danas i nakon ove premijere, siguran sam da konačno imam pečat na potvrdu da sam napravio najbolju stvar u svojoj dosadašnjoj karijeri - rekao je za Telegraf Željko Mitrović, posle velikih ovacija, i dodao: - Ali predstava Lu je samo početak, a granica je nebo... Svetske premijere u svetskom, a srpskom teatru tek slede. \"LU\" je predstava koja donosi priču o Princu Tame, Luciferu, iz potpuno drugačijeg ugla. Lucifer je po kazni poslat na Zemlju, među ljude. Ali postoje likovi koji mogu da iznenade i samog Lucifera. Kad pokuša da kupi dušu opštinskog funkcionera Srbe i usput se zaljubi u njegovu sestru Veru, Lucifer ne može da veruje šta ga je snašlo. Shvata šta je ljubav – da zbog nje žene plaču, a muškarci piju i lažu da ne plaču. I Lu je upao u tu klopku i mora da se izbori sam sa sobom, jer ako pokaže slabost – gubi sve što je Princu Tame važno. Sjajna glumačka postava predvođena je Žarkom Dimoskim, Markom Markovićem, Stojanom Đorđevićem, Miljanom Prljetom i Vesnom Paštrović.

    "Article Content": "Gost nove epizode video serijala \"Tanjug Reflektor\" bio je glumac Peđa Marjanović koji je govorio o trećoj sezoni serije \"Močvara\" i rekao da će publiku i treću sezonu serije povezati specifičan format. Marjanović je istakao da mu je bilo čudno da kroči u svet \"Močvare\" jer je, do tada, seriju posmatrao samo iz ugla gledaoca. \"Bilo je čudno kročiti u astmosferu, misterioznost i tajanstvenost, ali bilo mi je zanimljivo da gledam kako se to stvara. Kako Oleg to režira i kako vodi pažljivo glumce kroz to. I zapitao bih se da li ja sad snimam i prisustvujem ovde ili ne. Drugačije je, bez obzira što je čovek glumac, drugačije je kad učestvuješ i kad stvaraš, a drugačije je kada to posmatraš\", objasnio je on. Prema njegovim rečima, čast i privilegija je sarađivati sa rediteljem Olegom Novkovićem i igrati u komadima čije dramske tekstove piše Milena Marković. \"Učiš je na fakultetu i čitaš njene drame i sad odjednom razgovaraš sa njom i igraš u seriji koju je ona pisala. To je kao prisustvovati tom činu stvaranja i gledati njih kako rade. To je meni bilo najzanimljivije\", objasnio je Marjanović. Marjanović tumači ulogu mladog inspektora Miloša koji je \"štreberski nastrojen prema poslu i želi da se dokaže\". Pored toga, Marijanović je istakao da je ta uloga bila glumački zahtevna kada je scenario, koji se odnosi na prisustvo mrtvim telima, u pitanju. \"Nažalost sam imao iskustvo prisustva jednoj obdukciji iz ličnih razloga. Priključio sam se obdukciji nekog tela na pravnom fakultetu jer je moj cimer studirao prava.. Obdukciji je prisustvovao i neki profesor na akademiji i rekao nam je kako bi bilo super iskustvo da mi kao glumci odemo da pogledamo\", rekao je on. Prema njegovim rečima prisustvo obdukciji je posebno iskustvo iako se čovek u početku plaši da priđe čoveku koji nije živ. \"To zapravo nije čovek, ima obrise ljudskog, vidi se i misao na njemu i to je nešto što je bila osoba i to je nešto strašno. Mi nemamo iskustvo da vidimo ljude koji su mrtvi. Mi samo razgovaramo i komuniciramo sa živim ljudima i kad naiđeš na nešto što znaš da je bilo živo, a sad više nije, jako ti je to čudno\", rekao je Marjanović.

    "Article Content": "Fenomenalni britanski bend Singing loins, koji svira kako sami kažu \"sirovi folk sa Delte Midveja\", nastupio je sinoć u prepunom klubu Doma kulture. Ovo je njihov četvrti nastup u Pirotu, a u Srbiji su nastupali pre Pirota u Beogradu i Novom Sadu. U Pirot međutim dolaze četvrti put, zadnji put su bili pre više od decenije, a pevač benda Artur Alan kaže za Telegraf.rs da u Srbiju uvek rado dolaze i to sa posebnim emocijama. -Mi smo četvrti put u Pirotu. Zadnji put je bilo davno pre možda 15 godina, tada je sa nama bio i bivši frontmen benda i svojevrsno zaštitno lice benda Kris Broderik, koji je nažalost preminuo pre par godina. Sada ćemo dosta njegovih pesama svirati, ali u novom ruhu, imamo veći saund, imamo violinu, mandolinu u bendu, osim standardnog bubnja i dve gitare-kaže Alan, uz konstataciju da njega i njegove klupske drugare posebno oduševljava srpska hrana. -Hrana je ovde fenomenalna, svašta smo probali, mnogo vrsta mesa, sve je izvrsno, jedan od kolega je oduševljen pirotskim sirom, kačkavaljem, koga je probao ovde-priča Alan i dodaje da će bend na veliku evropsku turneju zapravo krenuti naredne godine, a ovo je svega nekoliko koncerata po Engleskoj, i odmah zatim Srbiji, kako bi se publici predstavio novi album. Alan kaže da jedna od stvari koji ih je fascinirala još kada su prvi put došli u Srbiju, bila činjenica da Srbi prosto obožavaju kultnu engelsku seriju Mućke. -Jedan od mlađih članova nije mogao da veruje kada je u Beogradu iz stana u kome smo bili, pogledavši kroz prozor, video ogroman grafit \"Only fools and horses\". Tada sam mu, s obzirom da sam ranije bio sa starom postavkom, objasnio da ovde svi obožavaju Rodnija, Del Boja i ostale aktere Mućki, što je potpuno fascinantno-kaže Alan. Koncert u Pirotu oduševio je publiku u holu Doma kulture koja je, na iznenađenje ovog kultnog benda, horski pevala brojne hitove \"Kraljeva Delte Midveja\", kako ih još nazivaju u Engleskoj. (A.Ć.)

    "Article Content": "U petak 13. septembra svečano je otvoren 20. festival evropskog dugometražnog dokumentarnog filma “7 veličanstvenih” u Mts dvorani. Prisutnima su se na otvaranju obratili direktor festivala Zoran Popović, festivalski selektor Tue Stin Miler, i autor filma otvaranja „Pijanoforte“ Jakub Pjontek. Zoran Popović, direktor festivala „7 veličanstvenih“, na otvaranju je rekao: „Pre dvadeset godina postojao je samo san o velikom sjajnom bioskopu, o velikom platnu, o fantastičnim filmovima i veličanstvenoj publici. Nakon 20 godina, svi smo zajedno u tom snu, koji je uspeo da se ostvari. Da li zato što smo uložili svu našu snagu, trud i energiju da otvorimo široko vrata filmovima koji su i u Evropi tek dolazili i najavljivali jedno novo poglavlje u istoriji filma; da li zato što smo imali podršku zaista sjajnih, veličanstvenih evropskih dokumentarista i jednog izuzetnog Danca koji je gotovo postao Beograđanin, Tue Stin Milera; da li zato što je sve to spojila jedna veličanstvena, evropska publika, koja voli dokumentarni film, bioskop, i uživa u onome što je magija filma. Sve to zajedno, tokom dvadeset godina, stvaralo je legendu o festivalu, koju širom Evrope pronose eminentni evropski dokumentaristi, pričajući o nečemu što gotovo da nikada u svojoj karijeri nisu sreli, a događa se u Beogradu“. Tue Stin Miler, selektor festivala, ispričao je priču o imaginarnom susretu Hansa Kristijana Andersena i Nikole Tesle, i njihovom razgovoru o budućnosti pokretnih slika. „Oni nisu više ovde, ali pre neki dan sedeli su na jednom oblaku iznad Beograda. Andersen je rekao Tesli kako je ipak postojala mogućnost da se slike pokrenu. U Beogradu ima jedna tačka i jedno mesto gde se već 20 godina prikazuju slike koje se pokreću. S tvojim genijalnim umom i mojim pripovedanjem, te dve stvari su se spojile u nešto što ide zajedno, nešto veličanstveno. Andersen je bio u pravu. Živeo festival Sedam veličanstvenih!“ Jakub Pjontek, reditelj filma otvaranja „Pijanoforte“, prisutnima se obratio rečima: „Veoma sam privilegovan što sam ovde. Mlađi sam od 40 godina, pa mi 20 godina festivala izgleda kao divan san. Hvala vam na gostoprimstvu i nadam se da ćete uživati u filmu“. Po završetku ceremonije otvaranja, premijerno u Srbiji je prikazan film “Pijanoforte” koji nas vodi na najčuvenije svetsko takmičenje mladih pijanista. Kao svojevrsna pijanistička Olimpijada, svake pete godine u Varšavi se okupljaju vrhunski mladi umetnici i započinju bespoštednu borbu sa samima sobom da bi postigli gotovo nemoguće i savladali sve teže i teže zadatke i eventualno pobedili. Sjajni poljski autor Jakub Pjontek napravio je uzbudljiv i intrigantan film koji nas vodi iza kulisa ovog takmičenja, a najveće zadovoljstvo u filmu je pijanistički i filmski briljantno predstavljena muzika koja je opčinila gledaoce brojnih festivala širom sveta od Sandensa do Tel Aviva. Nakon projekcije održan je razgovor sa autorom filma. Program festivala nastavlja se u subotu, 14. septembra u 20 časova, filmom “Balomanija” danske rediteljke Sisel Morel Dargis. Do kraja festivala publika će moći da pogleda i ostvarenja “Tvoj život bez mene” mađarske rediteljke Ane Rubi (15. septembar, 18h), “Šaptač risovima” finskog reditelja Juhe Suonpe (15. septembar, 20h), „Gospodin Bo“ italijanske rediteljke Klaudije Tozi (16. septembar, 20h), „Ja sam reka, reka je ja“ holandskog reditelja Petra Loma (17. septembar, 20h), „Nenet“ Nikole Filibera (18. septembar, 20h, specijalna projekcija) i „Bilo jednom u jednoj šumi“ finske rediteljke Virpi Sutari (19. septembar, 20h), koji će zatvoriti festival. Festival su pomogli Ministarstvo kulture Republike Srbije, Ambasade Finske i Danske u Srbiji uz druge sponzore i medijske pokrovitelje.

Enterijer Gocine dvospratna kuće opremljen je stilskim nameštajem i suvenirima, a kako je pevačica istakla, sve mora da joj bude pod konac. -Kod mene je red rad i disciplina i naravno red smeha - navela je pevačica i otkrila da je njena kuća zapravo njena oaza mira, a sve je dekorisala i opremila sama. Prostrani hodnik vodi do svih prostorija, a jedna od omiljenih prostorija joj je kuhinja jer ne može da zamisli dan bez jutarnje kafe. - Najviše volim ujutru da prvu kafu popijem potpuno sama, u tišini, ali napolju, u dvorištu. U stanju sam čak da sa skafanderom i kapom na glavi, čizmama izađem kada je hladno - priznala je Goca. I ne samo to, Goca je prava domaćica koja se ne libi da zasuče rukave i svojim najmilija pripremi specijalitete. - Spremam sve što moji vole, ali je sve to malo komplikovano jer moja ćerka ne jede meso, niti mast. Unuka ne jede sir, ni mleveno meso i onda kad dođe Božić kad se svi okupimo, ja pečem ćurku - priznala je pevačica. Osim u kuhinji, Goca većinu vremena provodi u trpezariji koju je opremila sa mnogo ljubavi. Elementi od punog drveta, svuda su zlatni detalji, uramljene skupocene slike na zidovima, vitrine sa posuđem i suvenirima koje je godinama donosila iz inostranstva. Cvetni aranžmani su neizostavni detalj svake prostorije, a malo ko zna da ih pevačica sama uzgaja u svojoj bašti. Pevačica poseduje i nekoliko spavaćih soba i kupatila na drugom spratu svoje raskošne kuće, te ne brine kada joj dođu gosti i članovi porodice jer ima dovoljno mesta da se svako od njih oseća komforno.

    "Article Content": "Pevačica   odlučila je da osnuje porodicu sa svojim partnerom, košarkašem  . Teodora godinu dana uživa u ljubavi sa svojim izabranikom Maticom, a navodi se da su odlučili da svoju vezu podignu na viši nivo. Iako se pevačica trudi da privatan život sačuva daleko od očiju javnosti, izvor blizak poznatom paru priča da oni već neko vreme rade na prinovi. - Teodora i Matic su se stvarno pronašli, oni su jednostavno srodne duše, funkcionišu kao jedno. Zaista su skladan par, oko svega se dogovaraju i svađe kod njih su nepoznanica. Ona nikada nije bila ovako srećna i zaljubljena, procvetala je otkad je sa njim, puna je nekog novog elena. Odavno su započeli zajednički život, te sada priželjkuju bebu i već neko vreme rade na tome. Oboje su porodični tipovi i žele veliku porodicu. Teodora je oduvek maštala da postane mlada mama i sada je shvatila da je Matic taj kome želi da podari dete i da provede ostatak života sa njim - otkrio je izvor blizak paru, koji je insistirao na anonimnosti i dodao da je dolaskom Teodorine bratanice na svet proradio i njen majčinski instinkt: - Teodorin brat Sava i snajka Adrijana nedavno su postali roditelji, što je u Teodori na neki način probudilo želju da i ona i Matic osnuju porodicu. Često ih posećuje jer voli da provodi vreme sa bebom, kad god ima slobodnog vremena. Razmišlja o tome kakva će ona majka biti, da li će se snaći, ima strah, ali isto tako i veliku želju za potomstvom. Da je među pevačicom i slovenačkim košarkašem sve idilično, svedoči činjenica da su Teodorini roditelji upoznali budućeg zeta, kao i njegovi nju, te da su im obe porodice dale blagoslov. - Teodorin otac, mama Goca i brat Sava oduševljeni su njenim izborom, Matic ih je kupio neposrednošću, skromnošću, ali i načinom na koji tretira Teodoru. Najbitnije im je da je ona srećna i zadovoljna, a kraj njega zaista blista, to svi primećuju. Kako je još izvor rekao, iako Goca Džehverović obožava zeta, pomalo strahuje da bi njena ćerka zbog eventualne trudnoće u budućnosti mogla da zapostavi karijeru: - Goca ne bi imala ništa protiv kada bi joj ćerka rekla da se udaje, ali smatra da ne sme da zapostavi karijeru. Teodora joj stalno priča da joj je proradio majčinski instinkt, pa Goca brine da bi sav trud uložen u njenu dosadašnju karijeru mogao da padne u vodu. Samo za stan u luksuznom beogradskom naselju iskeširala je oko 250.000 evra, a o pesmama i spotovima da i ne govorimo. Ove tvrdnje potvrdila je i sama Teodora, priznavši da bi volela da se mlada ostvari u ulozi majke. - Oduvek mi je bila želja da budem mlada mama. Ne mogu da preciziram godine, jer su jedno želje, a drugo mogućnosti, to su stvari koje ne možemo planirati. Istina je da jedva čekam da postanem majka. Želim da se ostvarim i u poslovnom smislu, ali i kao majka i žena, smatram da je to veoma važno - rekla je nedavno Teodora, piše  .

Sledeće nedelje ćemo imati sednicu Vlade na kojem ćemo usvojiti novu izmenu zakona u kojoj se skida suspenzija i skraćuje vojni rok, na tu sednicu pozvaćemo i predsednika Srbije, kao - objasnio je Vučević na konferenciji posle sednice Vlade. Vojni rok ne samo da će biti kraći nego ranije, već će   koje zahteva veće tehnološko znanje. - Mladi regruti koji završili tehničke škole ili tehnološke fakultete, mašinsku školu i mašinske fakultete moći će da služe vojni rok i na Vojnotehnološkom institutu i onim organizavionim delovima Vojske Srbije i Ministarstva Odbrane koje zahteva veće tehnološko znanje i da na taj način angažujemo njihove radne i ostale sposobnosti. Nama će trebati mladi momcvi koji znaju da voze bespilotne letelice i dronove, tako da imaćemo onaj klasičan oblik vojnog roka, ali imaćemo i za određene mladića koji su određenog profila školske spreme da mogu da u posebnim jedinicama vojske Srbije pomognu svojim znanjem i veštinama. To će biti jedan višeslojni oblik angažovanja regruta  prilikom služenja vojnog roka i mislim da je to i čast svih mladića koji će služiti vojni rok.  rekao je Vučević. Predsednik Srbije Aleksandar Vučić govorio je ranije o uvođenju vojnog roka u Srbiji u trajanju od 90 dana. - Obavezni vojni rok od 90 dana, a na nadležnim vojnim organima je da nam izvede računicu koliko bi to koštalo.   - uveren je Vučić. Obavezni vojni rok u Srbiji bio je suspendovan, a tome je ranije govorio Miloš Vučević. -  . Odluka o vraćanju vojnog roka nije doneta, ona zahteva ozbiljnu i stručnu analizu i ona se  . Imamo situacije sa elementarnim nepogodama – imamo poplave, požare, zemljotrese, smetove snega i svi tada očekuju od vojske ili policije da reaguju. Pre par nedelja bile su poplave u Raškoj, Novom Pazaru i Tutinu i ko je prvi tu bio, naravno vojska i policija. Svi kažu “bravo, momci!”, ali nema neograničenih resursa. To je odluka o kojoj treba razgovarati, ona se ne donosi preko noći, ali je niko nije doneo. Ako je problem da to pomenemo, onda hajde da ćutimo i da zabijemo glavu kao noj u pesak.

Kako izveštava britanski „Daily Mail“ pozivajući se na Trampove insajdere, čini se da su dvoje vodećih menadžera kampanje na ivici. Suzi Vils (67) i Kris Lakivita (58) su  .

Prema izvoru „Daily Mail-a“, bilo je uvredljivo što su omogućili „osobi koja negira 9/11 da uđe u avion 11. septembra“. Zbunjenost je očigledno eskalirala, a  . Razlog: Oni rade šta žele. I mogli su kao šefovi kampanje nešto da učine kako bi sprečili Lumerovu da dobije mesto u Trampovom avionu. Nekoliko sati pre TV debate, Lumerova je na platformi „X“ uputila na indijsko poreklo Kamale Harris i napisala da bi, ako demokratkinja pobedi na predsedničkim izborima u novembru, „Bela kuća mirisala na kari“ i da bi se govori u vladinoj zgradi „obavljali preko kol centra“. Lumer je, takođe, napisala i da migranti iz Haitija ne jedu samo pse i mačke: „Jedu ljude.“ U drugim objavama sugerisala je da su visoki američki zvaničnici bili umešani u napade 11. septembra 2001. godine i da je demokratski predsednik Džo Bajden (81) bio iza napada na Trampa, prenosi  . . - Ne znam mnogo o tome - rekao je 78-godišnji Tramp i dodao: - Ne znam šta je rekla, ali to nije moja stvar. Ne mogu Lori da kažem šta da radi.“ Kada je upitan o tome što ga je pratila u njegovom avionu, Tramp je odgovorio da to radi mnogo ljudi: „To je veliki avion.“ Kasnije je Tramp objavio saopštenje u kojem se donekle distancirao od Lumer: „ .\" I dodao: - Ne slažem se sa njenim izjavama, ali kao što je mnogo miliona ljudi koji me podržavaju, ona je umorna od gledanja kako radikalni levičari i marksisti nasilno napadaju i klevetaju mene, i čak čini sve što može da zaustavi svog političkog protivnika, MENE!

Komunikacija između Huse i policajca postala je viralna. Stariji gospodin imena  vozio se australijskim putevima na svom skuteru iako nije imao dozvolu za vožnju, a skuter nije bio ni registrovan. Uz sve to, Husina kaciga nije zadovoljavala sigurnosne standarde. Svima je zapalo za oko njegovo ponašanje tokom razgovora sa policajcem po imenu Deni. Naime, Huso je pokušao da se izvuče pričajući mešavinu bosanskog i engleskog jezika, ali mudra taktika mu nije prošla.  Dok je policajac, na engleskom jeziku, pokušao to objasniti starcu, ovaj ga je samo bledo gledao. - Kuda idete gospodine? Da li imate dozvolu? - pitao ga je policajac. - Nemam dozvolu, neregistrovan je. - Zašto onda vozite? I šta vam je to na glavi, šta je to? To nije kaciga za motor već za bicikl. Mogu li da vidim? Ukoliko padnete, ova kaciga vam neće pomoći. Možete poginuti - upozorio ga je čuvar reda. Potrudio se da objansi Husi da mu je odgovarajuća oprema neophodna za vožnju skutera, a  gospodin je to prihvatio s dozom sumnje. Dok je policajac pričao Huso je pokušao da upali motor i ode. - Ne možete nigde da idete, parkirajte skuter pored. Sačekajte trenutak, kažem vam. Molim Vas dajte mi dokumenta - nastavio je policajac. U tom trenutku policajac je pozvao nekoga da mu pomogne oko konverzacije, a kada mu je konačno objasnio čovek iz BiH nije imao kud. On je od nemoći počeo nešto da objašnjava i smekša policiju kako nebi dobio kaznu. - Ja sam Huso Sidran iz Hercegovinem, iz Bosne...Ma daj, bolan, pusti me u pi**u materinu. Ja ovako vozim 15 godina - nastavio je on. - No spik ingliš. Ne mogu, ne mogu. Nemoj me za***avati - odbrusio je Huso, koji je na kraju kažnjen s 295 dolara i 3 negativna prekršajna boda zbog nenošenja kacige...

    "Article Content": "Ciklon Boris je već izazvao haos u srednjoj Evropi, a ekološke vlasti u Rumuniji su na oprezu.  U Rumuniji, meteorolozi su izdali narandžasta upozorenja za kišu i poplave, . Očekuju se intenzivne padavine sa rizikom od poplava i niskim temperaturama. U Italiji, turisti su bili iznenađeni slojem snega od oko 30 centimetara, dok je u Austriji snega bilo još više. U Češkoj i Poljskoj, ciklon donosi obilne kiše sa akumulacijama vode koje bi mogle dostići do 400 litara po kvadratnom metru. Vlasti se boje da bi poplave mogle biti uporedive sa razornim iz 1997. godine. U galeriji fotografija možete videti kakvo je trenutno stanje u Češkoj. Stanovništvu se savetuje da prati uputstva lokalnih vlasti i pripremi se za ekstremne vremenske uslove, koji bi mogli ozbiljno uticati na infrastrukturu i zajednice u pogođenim oblastima prenose rumunski mediji. Ciklon se kreće prema severu, severoistoku, zadržaće se neko vreme u Istočnoj Evropi, a zatim skrenuti prema zapadu. Ova situacija obično donosi obilne kiše, katastrofalnih razmera, rekao je Tomáš Hrdinka, hidrološkinja iz TGM istraživačkog instituta. Ciklon Boris, sistem niskog pritiska visoke intenziteta, bio je jedan od najznačajnijih vremenskih fenomena koji su pogodili regione u blizini Indijskog okeana. Formiran u ranoj fazi sezone ciklona,  Ciklon Boris formiran je u tropskom regionu Indijskog okeana, inicijalno kao oblast niskog pritiska. Povoljni uslovi, kao što su visoke temperature okeanske vode i povoljni vetrovi, pomogli su u njegovoj intensifikaciji, pretvarajući ga u snažan ciklon. Njegov put uključivao je prolazak kroz nekoliko ostrva i obalnih regiona, izazivajući zabrinutost i pripreme za hitne intervencije u pogođenim oblastima. Suočeni sa ciklonom takve magnitude, lokalne i međunarodne vlasti mobilisale su resurse za upravljanje vanrednom situacijom. Informativne kampanje i kampanje za rano upozorenje bile su ključne za pripremu stanovništva i smanjenje rizika. Nakon prolaska ciklona, sprovedene su operacije spasavanja i oporavka kako bi se pomoglo pogođenim zajednicama da se obnove. Pored toga, humanitarne organizacije i međunarodne agencije pružile su pomoć i resurse za podršku naporima obnove. Hrvatska konkretno nije prošla teško kao što je prošlo sedište Evrope, rekao je za 24sata glavni direktor DHMZ-a Ivan Güttler. Otkrio je da će subota, što se tiče padavina, biti nešto mirnija, dok se nastavak većih očekuje krajem današnjeg dana i u nedelju. - Treba obratiti pažnju na vetar, buru i severna strujanja. U Hrvatskoj će biti značajnih padavina, ali ništa alarmantno. Puno više pratimo šta se dešava u centralnoj Evropi, gde su zaista ekstremne količine padavina, pa će to povećati pritisak i na naše reke, prvenstveno mislim na Dunav - rekao je šef DHMZ-a. Republički hidrometeorološki zavod ( ) upozorio je na obilne padavine danas i sutra na širem području Srbije, kao i na jak i olujni vetar na području Vojvodine i Zapadne Srbije. Večeras i u toku noći, kao i sutra, na području Vojvodine, Mačve, Šumadije, kao i na teritoriji Beograda očekuje se veća količina padavina, od 20 do 40 mm za period od 24 -36 sati, a na području Braničevskog okruga, lokalno i preko 40 mm, navodi RHMZ. Krajem dana i u toku noći ka nedelji, na području Vojvodine i zapadne Srbije duvaće jak severozapadni vetar, koji će u nedelju imati udare olujne jačine.

Zatečena je sa ranom od noža na vratu, a ispred kuće stajao je njen sin Kolin (17) koji je bio je prekrivljen krvlju. - Vikali su jedno na drugo u dvorištu, a onda ju je dečak uhvatio za kosu i odvukao u kuću. Ona je zapomagala \"pusti me, pusti me\". Nakon toga je dečak zatvorio vrata - ispričale su komšije, prenosi  Deečak je sam nazvao 911 i rekao je da ga je majka napala nožem i da je pala na nož i tako preminula. Policajci su brzo stigli na mesto nesreće, ali dečak nije hteo da kaže šta se dogodilo. Rekao je da želi dvokata. Inspektori su brzo shvatili da dečakova verzija priče da je majka pala na nož ne odgovara onome što se dogodilo, a to je potvrdio i nalaz obdukcije. Veštak je otkrio da je žena preminula od duboke rane na vratu koja ne odgovara priči da je sama pala na nož. Optužili su ga za ubistvo prvog stepena i traže da mu sude kao odraslom. Dečakova baka je vlasnica kuće, ali nije bila kod kuće kad se ovo dogodilo. Policiji je ispričala da su se Kolin i njegova majka često svađali i da je on imao problema. Samo dan pre ubistva, Ketrin je na Instagramu objavila fotografiju sa sinom. -   - napisala je majka stih iz pesme Tejlor Svift 'It's time to go'. Prošle godine Kolin je pucao u svog oca Čarlsa u Oklahomi. Policiji je ispričao da ga je otac napao u spavaćoj sobi pa je uzeo pištolj i pucao u njega dvaput, jednom u grudi i jednom u glavu. Imao je tada 15 godina, a njegova majka platila je 50 hiljada dolara kaucije kako bi sin izašao i branio se sa slobode. Optužbe protiv njega su odbačene, a tačno godinu dana nakon što je ubio oca, došao je da živi kod majke. Sad je i nju ubio.

Spasilačke službe borile su se da spasu 95 ljudi u teško pogođenim istočnim okruzima Galati i Vaslui, saopštilo je Odeljenje za vanredne situacije ne navodeći detalje o načinu smrti preminulih, prenosi AP. Helikopter \"Blek hok\" (Black Hawk) raspoređen je u Galati kako bi pomogao u misijama potrage i spasavanja. Nevreme je pogodilo 19 mesta u osam okruga u Rumuniji, a jak vetar je oborio desetine stabala koja su oštetila automobile i blokirala puteve i saobraćaj. Rumunski premijer Marsel Čolaku otkazao je planirane aktivnosti kako bi otputovao u okrug Galati i procenio posledice. Nadležne službe u nekoliko zemalja centralne Evrope saopštile su da će za vikend jake poplave pogoditi Češku, Poljsku, Austriju, Nemačku, Slovačku i Mađarsku. \"Moramo biti spremni za najgori scenario. Težak vikend je pred nama\", rekao je češki premijer Petr Fiala nakon sastanka vladinog centralnog kriznog komiteta. U Poljskoj, premijer Donald Tusk otputovao je juče u jugozapadni grad Vroclav, gde se predviđaju poplave. Ciklon se kreće prema severu, severoistoku, zadržaće se neko vreme u Istočnoj Evropi, a zatim skrenuti prema zapadu. Ova situacija obično donosi obilne kiše, katastrofalnih razmera, rekao je Tomáš Hrdinka, hidrološkinja iz TGM istraživačkog instituta. Ciklon Boris, sistem niskog pritiska visoke intenziteta, bio je jedan od najznačajnijih vremenskih fenomena koji su pogodili regione u blizini Indijskog okeana. Formiran u ranoj fazi sezone ciklona,  Ciklon Boris formiran je u tropskom regionu Indijskog okeana, inicijalno kao oblast niskog pritiska. Povoljni uslovi, kao što su visoke temperature okeanske vode i povoljni vetrovi, pomogli su u njegovoj intensifikaciji, pretvarajući ga u snažan ciklon. Njegov put uključivao je prolazak kroz nekoliko ostrva i obalnih regiona, izazivajući zabrinutost i pripreme za hitne intervencije u pogođenim oblastima. Suočeni sa ciklonom takve magnitude, lokalne i međunarodne vlasti mobilisale su resurse za upravljanje vanrednom situacijom. Informativne kampanje i kampanje za rano upozorenje bile su ključne za pripremu stanovništva i smanjenje rizika. Nakon prolaska ciklona, sprovedene su operacije spasavanja i oporavka kako bi se pomoglo pogođenim zajednicama da se obnove. Pored toga, humanitarne organizacije i međunarodne agencije pružile su pomoć i resurse za podršku naporima obnove.

Na taj način je praktično potvrdio da ta pomenuta povreda nije glavni razlog što je odbio da igra za Zmajeve protiv Holandije, što je izazvalo velike potrese kada je u pitanju sam Ahmedhodžić i reprezentacija. Najpre se oprostio od nacionalnog tima zbog uvreda koje je dobijao,  , a za sve je krivio njegovu ženu, Crnogrku Marijanu, koja je između ostalog prešla u islam zbog njega. Njegov život je nekoliko dana ličio na sapunicu, mnogi su ga u BiH isprozivali zbog onoga što je uradio, a čak je i otac Mirsad javno rekao da je od njega tražio da proveri DNK i uveri se da li je dete koje ima sa marijanom definitivno njegovo. U međuvremenu, Ahmedhodžić u Engleskoj uživa veliko poštovanje navijača Šefilda koji su očigledno shvatili šta se dešava u njegovom životu i pružili su mu podršku. Nakon utakmice su ga pozvali da dođe do njih, a dok ih je pozdravljao skandirali su mu \"Anel Ahmedhodžić.\" Na tribinama je viđena i zastava BiH, dok se i supruga Marijana oglasila na Instagramu i podelila detalje sa stadiona.

Napad na nju i njenog saputnika dogodio se oko 18 časova po lokalnom vremenu na putu između grada Daule i grada Gvajakil, gde se nalazi Kazneno-popravni dom Litoral. Ikaza je išla ka bolnici Guasmo Sur, koja se nalazi na jugu Gvajakila, kada su, prema lokalnim medijima, naoružani napadači presreli vozilo i pucali na nju, dok je sedela na mestu suvozača. Prvobitno je SNAI izvestio da je Ikaza preživela i da je prebačena u bolnicu, ali je kasnije potvrđeno da je mrtva prenosi  . Ministarstvo unutrašnjih poslova izrazilo je žaljenje zbog njenog ubistva i uputilo saučešće njenim voljenima i prijateljima. Ovo je drugo ubistvo zatvorskog službenika u poslednjih devet dana, nakon što je Aleks Guevara, direktor zatvora Lago Agrio u amazonskoj provinciji Sucumbíos, ubijen u sličnim okolnostima 3. septembra. Kazneno-popravni dom Litoral, zvanično poznat kao Guayas Muški Centar za Lišenje Slobode Broj 1, je najveći od pet zatvora koji čine zatvorski kompleks u Gvajakilu i smešta oko 12.000 zatvorenika. Više od 6.000 zatvorenika se nalazi u Kazneno-popravnom domu Litoral, koji je između 2021. i 2023. godine bio mesto najgorih masakra izazvanih sukobima između kriminalnih bandi koje su se borile za unutrašnju kontrolu, bar do militarizacije ovih centara koju je na početku godine naredio predsednik Daniel Noboa. Ulazak vojske u zatvorske objekte deo je okvira vanrednog stanja i \"unutrašnjeg oružanog sukoba\" koji je predsednik proglasio protiv organizovanog kriminala, što se pripisuje porastu kriminalnog nasilja koje je dovelo Ekvador do toga da bude zemlja u Latinskoj Americi sa najvećom stopom ubistava. Tokom prošle godine je iznosila 47,2 na 100.000 stanovnika.

    "Article Content": "Sada i Zvezda pravi nesportski faul i šalje Hantera na penale, koje oba puta koristi Vins. Zaharov promašuje novu trojku, ali i njemu lopta izlazi iz obruča. Pojtres ostaje protiv Branka Lazića i uspeva da iskoristi to. Postiže dva poena i ima dodatno bacanje usled faula, koje ne koristi. Branko Lazić promašuje novu trojku, a na drugoj strani Pojtres precizan i vraća tim na samo dva poena zaostatka. Novi promašaj Lazića, ovog puta ispod koša, ali lopta ostaje za Zvezdu. Faul u napadu pravi Spelmen, u bloku je bio previše čvrst i srušio je Jaga Mateuša. Napad uzima Zvezda. Kenan ide na prodor, ali promašuje novi pokušaj nečega što je ličilo na flouter. Bejkon uzima pretežak šut i dolazi do dva poena. Daum ide prelepo na prodor po prijemu lopte, polaže i pogađa. Pokušava Kenan ponovo za tri poena, ali opet promašuje, Zvezda trenutno ima 0/7 sa distance. Veoma čvrsto se igra, ali sudije ne dopuštaju to i brzo se prave faulovi. Jago pokreće prvi napadm, lopta do Plavšića, ali odbrana je iskočila i uradila dobar posao. Daum diže sa jedne noge u padu i pogađa poludistancu preko ruke. Zaharov pravi faul na Kenanu koji je ukrao loptu za dobar kontranapad. Bio je poslednji igrač odbrane i napravio je faul sa leđa. Precizan Kenan oba puta. Fauliran je Davidovac i imaće dva nova bacanja, a faul je nesportski, tako da će nakon toga imati i loptu sa strane. Precitan je samo u drugom pokušaju. Faul na Kenanu pravi Mun, dosta jak faul Muna. Nova bacanja, dosta loš ritam utakmice. Precizan Kenan sa bacanja oba puta. Spelman diže, pa promašuje trojku, Miler-Mekintajer ide na zakucavanje i odlično. Izgleda da su pukle arkade. Bilo je i krvi. Jedan igrač Zenita je morao da napusti teren. Lopta stiže do Plavšića od Kodija i nova dva laka poena. Kalinić uzima flouter preko ruke, ali promašuje. Mun ide u solo napad protiv Dauma i fauliran je Amerikanac. Zenit će imati dva slobodna bacanja. Mun pogađa svoje prvo slobodno bacanje u četvrtom pokušaju na ovom meču. Plavšić dobija odličan pas i dodatno slobodno bacanje će imati nakon pogotka preko ruke. To pogađa Uroš. Greši Kodi u kontranapadu, prekombinovao je sa Davidovcem. Sada izbacuje loptu na tri poena za Davidovca, ali ovaj promašuje taj šut. Pojtres postiže laka dva poena i tako vraća Zenit na samo poen zaostatka. Ide tajmaut Janisa Sferopulosa.

Kostić iz izlazne kretnje dobija pas od Kalinića, ali promašuje solidan šut za tri. Novi faul Zenita, ne mogu da zaustave Mekintajera, biće slobodna bacanja pri sledećoj ličnoj greški. Mitrović na pas Mekintajera poentira levom rukom na drugi obruč. Dobrić trči do koša, pravi roling, ali promašuje polaganje. Mun pravi faul na Mitroviću za dva slobodna bacanja, morao je da ga spreči da prvotimac Zvezde ne postigne lake poene. Promašuje prvo bacanje Luka Mitrović, ali je drugi put precizniji. Mekintajer organizuje novi napa, pas za Kalinića, pa napadom u trouglu lopta ide do Mitrovića za laka dva poena. Diže i pogađa trojku ekipa Zenita, a onda na drugoj strani Zvezda vraća za dva. Jago pokreće novi napad nakon dobre odbrane, ali flouterom promašuje ceo koš i lopta je opet za Zenit. Za sada Zvezda ne briljira, ne igraju loše, ali fale dobri napad i dobre odluke. Rampa Mitrovića, Kodi ulazi u kontranapad, lopta do Dobrića i biće dva slobodna bacanja. Precizan je oba puta. Novi kontranapad vodi Kodi i faulira ga Hanter, lopta je sa strane. Gube loptu, Hanter je krade i ide na zakucavanje. Nezgodan pad za Trenta Frejžera, nakon čega se držao za vrat i morao je da napusti teren. Dosta je ugruvan bivši igrač FMP-a. Dobio je dva bacanja, ali šutiraće neko drugi, precizni su oba puta. Odlična igra između Dobrića i Mitrovića, kombinacija i dupli pasovi dali su laka dva poena. Mitrović igra protiv Hantera, ali zbunio se i van balansa promašio. Mitrović ponovo dobija loptu na niski post od Jaga i precizan je nakon jednog promašaja. Novi poeni za Muna, ne može odbrana crveno-belih da ih zaustavi. Jago ostaje sam na šutu za tri poena, da završi prvu četvrtinu, ali šut je ostao kratak i promašio je ceo obruč.

Plavšić na drugoj strani gura Pojtresa ispod koša, ali promašuje. Fauliran je ponovo Miler-Mekintajer i pogađa oba bacanja. Dvejn Bejkon pokreće novi napad, ali Zvezda krade loptu na trenutak, da bi je potom izgubili i usledilo atraktivno zakucavanje. Kodi dodaje do Plavšića, koji na divan način podiže Pojtresa i postiže dva poena. Omari Spelmenu ispada lopta, a onda nakon ofanzivnog skoka dolaze igrači Zenita ipak do poena.

Njen nastup privukao je veliko interesovanje obožavalaca iz regiona, posebno iz susedne Rumunije, gde se ova muzička ikona posebno poštuje. Iz susedne zemlje, najavljen je dolazak na koncert čak 61 autobusa. Zanimljivo je da to nisu autobusi koji će doći iz Temišvara, nego iz drugih gradova, a iz Temišvara, koji je od Vršca udaljen oko 70 kilometara, očekuje se najmanje još toliko gostiju. Lokalna samouprava u Vršcu uspešno se dogovorila sa najvećom zvezdom na prostoru Balkana, pa će Lepa Brena pevati 15. septembra. Pored posetilaca iz Rumunije, očekuje se i oko 10.000 posetilaca iz svih ostalih krajeva jer Brenini koncerti su spektakl. Lepa Brena je preko 40 godina na sceni. Iza sebe ima brojne uspehe, koncerte na punim stadionima, arene, filmove koji se sa istim žarom emituju i gledaju i dan danas, ima najtiražnije albume, velike turneje… I sve je to samo deo onog što čini karijeru naše poznate pevačice. Oriće se Vršcem hitovi poput: Duge noge, Došlo vreme da se pođe, Bato Bato, Bice Belaja, Danas plačem ja a sutra ćeš ti, Sitnije Cile sitnije, Boli me uvo za sve, Ja nemam drugi dom, Kuća laži, Pazi kome zavidiš, Kralj, Sledeći, Četiri godine, Dama Iz Londona, Dečko mi je školarac… i još mnogi drugi.

U videu od 45 minuta koje je za nekoliko sati pogledala desetina hiljada ljudi, čuveni Vova je obišao delove Beograda koji nisu turistički -  buvljake, nehigijenska naselja, divlje deponije. Prčao je i o sukobima Srba sa pridošlim Rusima, zamerkama koje dobijaju, automobilima na ulicama koje je opisao rečju \"smeće\", bučnim komšijama u zgradama, lenjim srpskim radnicima i mnogo čemu drugom. Neki će reći da je preterao, a neko da je ukazao na naše nedostatke i minuse. Mnogi Rusi su mu se požalili da ih Srbi kritikuju što se ne integrišu, a jedan od Rusa u snimku, koje je jutjuber intervjuisao, bio je šokiran prizorom sa buvljaka -   tvrdi da je tamo video veštačku vaginu. Komentari na snimak su raznovrsni - od \"ahahahaha, za 550 evra iznajmljuju ovu štalu sa psima u dvorištu i bubašvabama?! Bože, kako nas muzu, ljudi deluju OK, ali kako pristati na takve uslove?\" \"Selektivno negativno subjektivno iskustvo više ljudi. Odvratno. Ovde se uopšte ne radi o Srbiji\", glasio je drugi komentar. \"Momci kojima su po želji isključili muziku imali su veliku sreću. Normalno je da se ovde postavljaju koncertne ulične zvučnike i pali turbo-folk po celoj ulici (da se čuje kilometar unaokolo) cele noći. Došli smo do njih i zamolili ih da utišaju oko ponoći, kada smo shvatili da niko neće zaustaviti zabavu - gledali su nas potpuno bez razumevanja :). Rekli su dođi kod nas na rakiju, rođendan nam je. Bili smo kao - ehhh, napolju je noć, stišaj, ne. Na kraju, žurka je trajala do 2 sata ujutru, dok neko od meštana nije izdržao i pozvao policiju, svaka čast, došli su, ne baš brzo, ali su došli. Ove komšije nas sada ne pozdravljaju, jer misle da smo mi zvali policiju...\", opisao je drugi Rus svoje muke u komentarima. Šta vi mislite?

Ukoliko bolest nije na vreme registrovana i lečena na odgovarajući način, pacijent može da umre usled teške dehidracije.  Veliki broj zaraženih nema simptome bolesti, dok se kod jednog broja pacijenata javlja akutna dijareja i teška dehidracija. Stručnjaci naglašavaju da je kolera bolest koja se lako leči, ali „ako se ne leči, može da ubije čoveka u roku od nekoliko sati“. Prema podacima stručnjaka, 1 od 10 ljudi bolesnih od kolere razviće ozbiljne simptome. Kod onih koji imaju simptome, smrt može nastupiti u roku od nekoliko sati ukoliko se ne počne sa odgovarajućim lečenjem. Tokom 2020. godine, od kolere je umrlo 857 osoba u 24 zemlje. Veruje se da je stvarni broj mnogo veći, navodi Svetska zdravstvena organizacija. Kolera je teška akutna crevna bolest a praendemsko žarište kolere je delta Ganga i Bramaputre. Izazivač je Vibrion cholerae, gram-negativni, aerobni bacil, klasičnog ili El Tor biotipa.  Česta i   povraćanje i jaki stomačni grčevi su mogući znaci bolesti. Stručnjaci savetuju da se u rizičnim zemljama pije flaširana, prečišćena voda i da se vodi računa o higijeni. Vakcinacija pruža privremenu zaštitu osobama za koje postoji veliki rizik od inficiranja, ili im je oslabljen imunitet. Pre dve godine, u   Serološkim testovima  , potvrđeno je da se radi o koleri. Kineski stručnjaci su preuzeli, kako naglašavaju, sve neophodne mere kako bi se pronašli kontakti i zaustavilo moguće širenje bolesti. Za sada nisu otkriveni novi slučajevi kolere, a posle lečenja, stanje pacijenta kod kojeg je potvrđena kolera je „ „, saopštilo je Okružno odeljenje za zdravstvo Univerziteta Vuhan. Nakon efikasne dijagnoze i lečenja, stanje pacijenta je postalo stabilno, a simptomi su nestali, saopštio je lokalni Centar za kontrolu i prevenciju bolesti.  Poslednji slučajevi kolere u Srbiji zabeleženi su 1989. godine kada je registrovano 16 slučajeva u Dimitrovgradu. Takođe, 1984. su registrovana dva slučaja kod naših građana koji su se oboleli vratili u zemlju i koji su se zarazili na putovanju u zemlje u kojima je kolera endemska bolest. \"Mi naših slučajeva kolere nismo imali u dugom vremenskom periodu, tako da nema osnova za strah, ali da je neophodna opreznost, posebno kada putujemo u rizična područja\", napomenula je u februaru ove godine u Jutarnjem programu dr Violeta Rakić, specijalista epidemiologije sa Instituta za javno zdravlje „Dr Milan Jovanović Batut“.

Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. , koje se suočava sa velikim  Nemački kancelar Olaf Šolc rekao je na zajedničkoj konferenciji za novinare u Berlinu sa kenijskim predsednikom Vilijamom Rutom da zahvaljujući ovom sporazumu, kvalifikovani radnici će moći da dođu u Nemačku, a mladi ljudi će moći da dođu na studije. Prema rečima kancelara, ova saradnja može pomoći u ublažavanju nedostatka radne snage, čiji efekti su već osetni u nemačkoj ekonomiji, izveštava MTI, a prenosi  . - Osnova naše sreće je to što smo otvoreni prema svetu, i moramo očuvati to - izjavio je Šolc, dodajući da je, pored otvorenosti, veoma važno jasno ograničiti ilegalnu imigraciju. Nemački kancelar je rekao da sporazum takođe obezbeđuje da se oni koji nezakonito borave u Nemačkoj mogu efikasnije da se vrate u Keniju. Viliam Ruto pohvalio je \"ogroman ljudski kapital\", inovativnu snagu i kreativnost svoje zemlje. Istakao je da je prosečna starost stanovništva u Keniji 20 godina. Nemačka vlada je već potpisala slične sporazume o migraciji sa Indijom, Marokom i Gruzijom, a sledeće nedelje će potpisati ugovor sa Uzbekistanom. Takođe se priprema slična saradnja sa Moldavijom, Kirgistanom i Filipinima. Prema  , Kenija ima 56.658.088 stanovnika. Prosečna plata u Keniji varira u zavisnosti od nekoliko faktora kao što je iskustvo, industrija u kojoj radi, kao i na kojoj lokaciji ali i nivo obrazovanja. Prosečna mesečna plata u Keniji, u različitim sektorima, procenjuje se između 30.000 i 130.000 kenijskih šilinga (KES) mesečno piše na sajtu  . Ovakav potez se verovatno može osetiti i na koži naših gastarbajtera, jer sada u Nemačku stiže radna snaga koja je radila za 200 evra mesečno! Inače, pretpostavlja se da u Nemačkoj živi između 400.000 i 800.000 Srba. Podsetimo, Nemci su 1. juna uveli novi zakon o useljavanju kvalifikovanih radnika, koji ima za cilj da privuče više kvalifikovanih radnika iz zemalja koje nisu članice EU-a, što je i te kako značajno za Srbiju. Prema podacima iz avgusta, tzv. kartice prilike izdato je skoro 200 viza po ovoj pravnoj osnovi, navelo je tada Ministarstvo spoljnih poslova. Postoje i poeni za kvalifikacije u deficitarnim zanimanjima. Svako ko ima dovoljan broj poena može doći u Nemačku i onda ima godinu dana da traži stalni posao. Pod određenim uslovima moguće je jednokratno produženje za dve godine. (Telegraf Biznis) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona   (  /   /  ).

Odlično je poznato da na jugu Srbije su plate užas pa i tih 250evra (konkretno u Pazaru, radnice u marketima, trafikama, radi se za pola minimalca), malo severnije zarade rastu.. Međutim ne preko tih 950 evra kao u Keniji, profesori u srednjim skolama, medicinsko osoblje, uzeo sam ih kao najplacenije u našem društvu..
